_AI försöker förstå oss... Ha överseende med galna feltranskriberingar._

`1 00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000`
Välkomna till den här korta intervjun som har blivit tillbaka av Säkerhetssäkerheten och Säkerhetssäkerheten.



`2 00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:17,000`
Vi har intervjuat språkarna under avsnittet och nu har vi Saaz Brooks här med oss.



`3 00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:27,000`
Han har just tillverkat en fantastisk och spektakulär tal om hur man förstör data.



`4 00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,000`
Jag tänkte att vi kunde nämna dig för Doktor Destruct eller något sådant.



`5 00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000`
Det har en fin ring till det och jag är en doktor.



`6 00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000`
Jag tror att du är en villain i något.



`7 00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000`
Så du är doktor i fysik eller kemi?



`8 00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000`
Elektrisk ingenjör och komputervetenskap.



`9 00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000`
I robotik.



`10 00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000`
Det är oroligt.



`11 00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000`
Jag tycker att robotar är ganska coola.



`12 00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000`
Det är det jag har studerat.



`13 00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000`
Inte i robotik men i elektrik.



`14 00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000`
I elektrisk ingenjör.



`15 00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:11,000`
Innan vi går in på vad du pratade om så vill vi fråga dig hur du kom in i säkerhet och den här området.



`16 00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000`
Jag arbetar mest av tiden i området.



`17 00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000`
Det är bara en vanlig intresse.



`18 00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000`
Men jag har alltid varit en hackare.



`19 00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000`
Jag vill alltid veta hur saker fungerar, ta dem bort och använda dem



`20 00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000`
i sätt som aldrig var förväntat.



`21 00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000`
Ibland får du platser som du inte ska gå.



`22 00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000`
Eller gör saker som du inte ska göra.



`23 00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000`
Ibland är det bara för att kunna se hur det fungerar.



`24 00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000`
Att kunna använda det i dina egna projekt.



`25 00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000`
Utifrån min ursäkt.



`26 00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000`
Ja, jag tror att du kan säga det.



`27 00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000`
Så om vi pratar om hackning.



`28 00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000`
Vad är den coolaste hacken i historien?



`29 00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000`
I historien?



`30 00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000`
Det är en svår fråga.



`31 00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000`
För hackning är något som är inseparabelt från teknologi.



`32 00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000`
Och teknologin är alltid förändrad.



`33 00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000`
Så jag tror att det är svårt att ta bort vad som är bäst.



`34 00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000`
Men coola saker fortsätter att hända hela tiden.



`35 00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000`
Jag tror att historiskt talat är telefonfreakning,



`36 00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000`
hela den generella naturen av telefonfreakning,



`37 00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000`
är den coolaste.



`38 00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000`
För på den tiden...



`39 00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000`
Ja, på den tiden var telefonsystemet,



`40 00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000`
den internationella telefonsystemet,



`41 00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000`
den mest komplicerade maskin som människor någonsin har byggt.



`42 00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000`
Det var helt fantastiskt.



`43 00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000`
Och alla de här människorna hade att förstå hur det fungerade



`44 00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000`
med väldigt lite insidig information.



`45 00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000`
Och hur man får den att respondera till sina ord.



`46 00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000`
Så det är lite som internet, men fundamentalt lite annorlunda



`47 00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000`
i tanke på dokumentationen som var tillgänglig.



`48 00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000`
Och att med internet kan man göra allt.



`49 00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000`
Det är hela målet.



`50 00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000`
Men telefonsystemet var inte designat för att göra något annorlunda än rätten.



`51 00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000`
Men folk använde det för alla typer av galna saker.



`52 00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000`
Jag skulle säga att telefonfreakning är en cool område.



`53 00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000`
Men tidigare...



`54 00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000`
Det är mycket bra saker som kommer ut hela tiden.



`55 00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000`
Och två tidigare exempel



`56 00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000`
är den personen som uppfattade hur man kan hacka



`57 00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000`
Onitys hotelldörrklockar.



`58 00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000`
För det är ett exempel på en superhögimpakt hack.



`59 00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000`
Med ganska vanlig hardware.



`60 00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000`
Han kompromiserade lockar över hela världen.



`61 00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000`
Och det är inte så lätt att göra med fysiska lockar.



`62 00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000`
Men elektroniska lockar ger dig chansen



`63 00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000`
och kan förstöra allt.



`64 00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000`
Det var en cool fråga på Defqon i år som jag gillade.



`65 00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000`
Min mamma frågade mig efteråt.



`66 00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000`
Kan du bygga en av dessa för mig?



`67 00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000`
Jag har en som jag behöver öppna.



`68 00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000`
En person som har byggt en autosäkerhetshackare.



`69 00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000`
Autodialer är ingenting nytt.



`70 00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000`
Men hans tjej hade givit honom en säkerhetshackare.



`71 00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000`
Vi vet inte vad som finns i den.



`72 00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000`
Men jag tror att jag kan bygga den.



`73 00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000`
Och han använde robotikpartier för barn.



`74 00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000`
För att bygga en autosäkerhetshackare.



`75 00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000`
Men det var en riktigt fin hack.



`76 00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000`
Jag har autosäkerhetshackar när folk demonstrerar



`77 00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000`
att öppna dem med en potatis.



`78 00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000`
Det är som...



`79 00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000`
Okej, det finns en förklaring till detta.



`80 00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000`
Men det är ändå så dumt och så coolt



`81 00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000`
att man bara kan smäcka en potatis i en säkerhetshackare



`82 00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000`
innan den öppnas.



`83 00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000`
Det är det ultimata.



`84 00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000`
Det finns inget som är mer lågt tekniskt än en potatis.



`85 00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000`
Kinetiska attacker.



`86 00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,040`
Avmärkt.



`87 00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:42,000`
Din språk idag för dig var om det om att



`88 00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000`
löpa data på ett灰.



`89 00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000`
Du pratade om utmaningen att löpa data



`90 00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:58,760`
Det är lite som i en Mythbusters-mål, att blåsa upp harddriven.



`91 00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:06,120`
Jag har känt att du har en väldigt låg definition av kontainerad.



`92 00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:13,240`
Det här beror mycket på min erfarenhet och de människor jag arbetade med.



`93 00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,440`
Och vår anledning till om det var möjligt.



`94 00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,960`
För vi gick inte helt till proof of concept.



`95 00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:26,520`
Men jag är ganska säker på att vi kunde bygga något som innehåller de originella specifikationerna.



`96 00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,960`
Coolare hardware och extrema metoder.



`97 00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,560`
En U är nära tre inchar.



`98 00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:38,680`
Och nära tre inchar av rejäl stål är en ganska seriös slugg att konfina något med.



`99 00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,720`
Jag tänkte på...



`100 00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,960`
\...destruktionen.



`101 00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,080`
Det såg ut som att du hade mycket ro med att göra alla dessa erfarenheter.



`102 00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:49,880`
Men vad...



`103 00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:54,360`
\...vad gjorde dig till den här utmaningen i första stället?



`104 00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:00,120`
Jag fick idén från en Defqon-tal som jag hade sett några år senare.



`105 00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:05,000`
Den var gjord av Divian Alam och Bruce Potter.



`106 00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,080`
De var båda riktigt roliga, det var en riktigt rolig tal.



`107 00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,040`
Men i slutändan, det gjorde mig tänka.



`108 00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,640`
Och vissa av de bästa talen gör det.



`109 00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,120`
De gör dig tänka, hur skulle jag uppmärksamma detta?



`110 00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,720`
För de försökte inte allt.



`111 00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,000`
Och jag är lite...



`112 00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,960`
Jag är lite unikt situerad i att jag har riktigt bra kontakter i explosiv...



`113 00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,680`
\...i olika explosiv- och pyrotechnik-relaterade industrier.



`114 00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,840`
Så jag kände att jag kunde göra den här typen av arbete.



`115 00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:35,640`
Och som jag sa i talet, jag hade också tänkt länge om 3D-printing av höga explosiv.



`116 00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,320`
Och jag ville göra det också.



`117 00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:42,040`
Så de motivationerna kom ihop och jag tänkte, låt oss göra detta.



`118 00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,800`
Låt oss bara stoppa med att tala om det och tänka om det.



`119 00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,840`
Låt oss faktiskt göra det hända.



`120 00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,320`
Coolt.



`121 00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,920`
Och ha lite ro med det.



`122 00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,160`
Ja.



`123 00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:47,480`
Men...



`124 00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:47,800`
Men...



`125 00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,120`
Men...



`126 00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,360`
Men...



`127 00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:48,840`
Men...



`128 00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,400`
Men...



`129 00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:49,720`
Men...



`130 00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:49,960`
Men...



`131 00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,200`
Men...



`132 00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:50,360`
Men...



`133 00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:50,760`
Men...



`134 00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,840`
Men...



`135 00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:07,320`
Men...



`136 00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:07,640`
Men...



`137 00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:07,720`
Men...



`138 00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:07,800`
Men...



`139 00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:07,880`
Men...



`140 00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,360`
Men...



`141 00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:08,520`
Men...



`142 00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:08,560`
Men...



`143 00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,200`
Men...



`144 00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:14,480`
Men...



`145 00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:14,680`
Men...



`146 00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:14,720`
Men...



`147 00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:14,920`
Men...



`148 00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:14,960`
Men...



`149 00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,320`
Men...



`150 00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:15,780`
Men...



`151 00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:15,960`
Men...



`152 00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,020`
Men...



`153 00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:16,040`
Men...



`154 00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,440`
Men...



`155 00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:16,640`
Men...



`156 00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,240`
Men...



`157 00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:17,320`
Men...



`158 00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:17,360`
Men...



`159 00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:17,480`
Men...



`160 00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:17,560`
Men...



`161 00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:17,760`
Men...



`162 00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,200`
Men...



`163 00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:18,620`
Men...



`164 00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:18,820`
Men...



`165 00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,840`
careful person when it comes to this type of stuff



`166 00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,000`
and especially



`167 00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,460`
the high explosives work



`168 00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,780`
we actually did that under the supervision of the local



`169 00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,280`
bomb squad in Colorado



`170 00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,680`
so we had a police officer



`171 00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,260`
with us the whole time and



`172 00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,820`
there was no way, as well as people



`173 00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,680`
who were licensed to



`174 00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,740`
handle and use high explosives



`175 00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,500`
so there was no way that any corners



`176 00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,880`
were going to be cut on that work



`177 00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,940`
in terms of safety, so we were very



`178 00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,580`
cautious about everything, all those shots



`179 00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,000`
were done with us



`180 00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,600`
over



`181 00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,560`
like a hill



`182 00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,060`
of earth and behind a vehicle



`183 00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,540`
so there was no direct line that a



`184 00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,400`
fragment could travel



`185 00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,540`
we did everything by the book



`186 00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,400`
and that wasn't



`187 00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,760`
there's no book for thermite and stuff like that



`188 00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,480`
so the earlier experiments were



`189 00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,640`
a little bit more goofy



`190 00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,460`
but we still followed appropriate safety



`191 00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,480`
protocols to make sure that no one was ever in



`192 00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,540`
any kind of serious danger



`193 00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:16,460`
Your presentation contains



`194 00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,800`
some very spectacular



`195 00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,740`
high frame rate footage



`196 00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,480`
you weren't afraid of



`197 00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,440`
putting expensive equipment



`198 00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,820`
close to these explosions



`199 00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:28,940`
Certainly



`200 00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:32,140`
the owners of that expensive



`201 00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,780`
equipment were concerned



`202 00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,960`
but once again, we just did everything properly



`203 00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,240`
because when I set out to do



`204 00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,180`
this work, I said right from the beginning



`205 00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,120`
it's really important that we get



`206 00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,500`
some high speed footage of this



`207 00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,720`
so that the audience can really appreciate it



`208 00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,660`
and so that we can also see



`209 00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,660`
what's going on



`210 00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,340`
so I knew from the beginning



`211 00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,900`
I was going to need to use these cameras



`212 00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,000`
that cost $25,000 or more



`213 00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,820`
so you just don't take risks



`214 00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:57,960`
so we actually



`215 00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,620`
I didn't show it in the presentation



`216 00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,760`
but we built



`217 00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,580`
protective enclosures for all the cameras



`218 00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,400`
the only camera actually that wasn't protected



`219 00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,340`
was my camera, which I put on a tripod



`220 00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,700`
and I just was like, well, if it gets hit



`221 00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,500`
it gets hit, I'm willing to lose it



`222 00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,600`
but the other ones were in



`223 00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,340`
metal ammunition boxes



`224 00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,400`
with bulletproof lecterns



`225 00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,200`
and shields on them



`226 00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,700`
so we just, you know



`227 00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,340`
I told the people



`228 00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,880`
if we break the camera



`229 00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,320`
I'll pay for it



`230 00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,780`
and I didn't want to be liable for $25,000



`231 00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:30,120`
so we did everything right



`232 00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:38,620`
Yeah, it was 100,000 frames per second footage



`233 00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,460`
and that was on Phantom camera or something



`234 00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,880`
That's actually beyond a Phantom



`235 00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,060`
Yeah, so actually that footage right at the end



`236 00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:44,980`
of the can crushes



`237 00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:47,100`
that was something we shot for a



`238 00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,660`
Discovery Channel TV show called Time Warp



`239 00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,660`
which I was a segment producer on



`240 00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,160`
so we had done a big sequence for that show



`241 00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,660`
on high voltage things



`242 00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,160`
and some of it made it to air



`243 00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,160`
and some of it didn't



`244 00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,160`
so one of the main reasons that I included that in there



`245 00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,160`
was I just wanted people to see



`246 00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,160`
how crazy that was



`247 00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,660`
because it was never in the show



`248 00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,660`
I don't think



`249 00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,660`
and we shot all the footage



`250 00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,660`
so I managed to get hold of the footage



`251 00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,660`
and put it in there because



`252 00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,660`
they, uh



`253 00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,660`
it's just so cool, right?



`254 00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,660`
to use electricity to just smash a can like that



`255 00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:26,660`
and so that stuff was shot on a camera called a Photron



`256 00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,660`
SA-1 or SA-2



`257 00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,660`
and those things are half a million dollar cameras



`258 00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:35,660`
but yeah, so I couldn't have even afforded to rent those



`259 00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,660`
but I had that footage anyway from Time Warp



`260 00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,660`
Cool



`261 00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:43,660`
Anyway, in the beginning you were talking about



`262 00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:47,660`
governments trying to collect



`263 00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,660`
fragments of hard drives



`264 00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:53,660`
and trying to extract information from those



`265 00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,660`
really, I mean



`266 00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,660`
in my experience



`267 00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:01,660`
once a hard drive has been



`268 00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,660`
physically deformed



`269 00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,660`
it is very, very



`270 00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:09,660`
implausible that someone would be able to extract information from that



`271 00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,660`
so



`272 00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:16,660`
have you heard any rumors that there actually



`273 00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,660`
is



`274 00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:20,660`
any technology that possibly could



`275 00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,660`
could extract information from a hard drive



`276 00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,660`
let's say that you punch a nail through?



`277 00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,660`
Yeah, so



`278 00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,660`
that's a really interesting question



`279 00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,660`
and it's something that



`280 00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,660`
anyone who does know the answer to



`281 00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,660`
isn't allowed to talk about it, right?



`282 00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,660`
So, I guess what I have on that subject is



`283 00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,660`
technically rumor



`284 00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,660`
it's second hand information



`285 00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,660`
but it came from



`286 00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,660`
as I said in the talk



`287 00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,660`
a guy who was recovering



`288 00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,660`
information



`289 00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,660`
intelligence information in Iraq



`290 00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,660`
after the American invasion



`291 00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,660`
and he was under instructions from the NSA



`292 00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,660`
to collect and send to them any



`293 00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,660`
storage material



`294 00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,660`
that had not been both



`295 00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:04,660`
crushed or shredded and burned



`296 00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,660`
and they told him



`297 00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,660`
because, you know, they didn't want to



`298 00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,660`
presumably they don't waste this guy's time



`299 00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,660`
so they told him



`300 00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,660`
if you find a disk that's been crushed



`301 00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,660`
or cut in half, whatever



`302 00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,660`
send it to us because it's still useful to us



`303 00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,660`
so



`304 00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,660`
the implication is that they have



`305 00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,660`
methods of recovery and



`306 00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,660`
I, you know, as a robotics person



`307 00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,660`
I can think of ways that I would approach that problem



`308 00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,660`
right, so



`309 00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,660`
I could think of designing a system that



`310 00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,660`
took a platter and



`311 00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,660`
3D imaged it to get



`312 00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,660`
the exact curvature and then swept



`313 00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,660`
a robot arm



`314 00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,660`
with a reed head over the top of that



`315 00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,660`
at the reed height



`316 00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,660`
it's totally feasible to do



`317 00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,660`
from a control perspective



`318 00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,660`
and



`319 00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,660`
modern drives are so data dense



`320 00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,660`
yeah, that's another thing



`321 00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,660`
a small piece



`322 00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,660`
you know, still would



`323 00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,660`
potentially hold a lot of data



`324 00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,660`
like an individual file



`325 00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,660`
could reside in a very small piece of disk



`326 00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,660`
but on the other hand



`327 00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,660`
I mean, the data density itself



`328 00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,660`
poses a problem



`329 00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,660`
in recovery because you



`330 00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,660`
you don't have tracks anymore



`331 00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,660`
like you did on the old type of hard drives



`332 00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,660`
I mean, you're



`333 00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,660`
relying on



`334 00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,660`
magnetic information



`335 00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,660`
and



`336 00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,660`
it's actually like a voice coil



`337 00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,660`
that positions the



`338 00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,660`
reed head on the platter



`339 00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,660`
so I would think



`340 00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,660`
it would be



`341 00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,660`
near impossible, at least in



`342 00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,660`
for a civilian



`343 00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,660`
authority



`344 00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,660`
but how many tens of millions



`345 00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,660`
of dollars



`346 00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,660`
if you threw that at the problem



`347 00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,660`
could it become tractable, right?



`348 00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,660`
because the intelligence budget in the United States



`349 00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,660`
is many hundreds of millions of dollars



`350 00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,660`
and I mean, it doesn't need to mean that



`351 00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,660`
they think it's



`352 00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,660`
recoverable today



`353 00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,660`
when you go by military and they



`354 00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,660`
have 30 years



`355 00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,660`
expectancies and so



`356 00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,660`
it could be



`357 00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,660`
they expect that in the future we might



`358 00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,660`
have technology that could recover something



`359 00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,660`
yeah, and it could be like



`360 00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,660`
maybe they do the first



`361 00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,660`
triage and



`362 00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,660`
these are very unlikely



`363 00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,660`
we ever can recover



`364 00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,660`
and these are slightly



`365 00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,660`
possible that if we throw a lot of money on it



`366 00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,660`
and then if they get over intelligence



`367 00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,660`
that says



`368 00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,660`
drives recovery in this area might be



`369 00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,660`
very very important



`370 00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,660`
then they might push



`371 00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,660`
those extremely expensive



`372 00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,660`
measures on those particular



`373 00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,660`
disks, so if they



`374 00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,660`
recovered 100,000 badly damaged



`375 00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,660`
drives, maybe just five



`376 00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,660`
actually went through the most expensive



`377 00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,660`
most complex procedures



`378 00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,660`
and a lot of it just depends on



`379 00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,660`
what's your personal



`380 00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,660`
risk comfortability



`381 00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,660`
if I was



`382 00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,660`
if my life was



`383 00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,660`
in danger from the material on those drives



`384 00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,660`
or if my freedom was in danger



`385 00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,660`
if I was a criminal running a darknet market



`386 00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,660`
or something like that, then I would be very paranoid



`387 00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,660`
even excessively



`388 00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,660`
so, you know, it's like



`389 00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,660`
why take a risk you don't have to



`390 00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,660`
that's true, I mean



`391 00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,660`
you can never be too sure



`392 00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,660`
and of course



`393 00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,660`
my experience is from



`394 00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,660`
the field of forensics and



`395 00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,660`
there you have conventional methods



`396 00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,660`
which means that



`397 00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,660`
a damaged drive or



`398 00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,660`
damaged read heads or



`399 00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,660`
something like that, that's



`400 00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,660`
completely possible to recover



`401 00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,660`
but it's



`402 00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,660`
it becomes



`403 00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,660`
almost impossible



`404 00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,660`
if the platters



`405 00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,660`
are damaged or somehow



`406 00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,660`
physically



`407 00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,660`
have any defects on them



`408 00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,660`
because they're going to destroy the equipment



`409 00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,660`
that you're using to recover the data



`410 00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,660`
but yeah



`411 00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,660`
I mean given infinite



`412 00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,660`
budgets



`413 00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,660`
it might be possible



`414 00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,660`
possibly plausible



`415 00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,660`
at least



`416 00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,660`
I mean I think it's an interesting thought experiment



`417 00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,660`
so



`418 00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,660`
anyway, thank you for



`419 00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,660`
taking this time to



`420 00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,660`
talk to us during this interview



`421 00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,660`
you're welcome, thanks for having me



`422 00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,660`
and we'll



`423 00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,660`
go down and listen to some of the



`424 00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,660`
lightning talks



`425 00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,660`
I'm psyched



`426 00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,660`
what kind of destruction



`427 00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,660`
or something



`428 00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,660`
you would like to do



`429 00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,660`
that you haven't done yet



`430 00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,660`
what's in life



`431 00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,660`
is there anything you have



`432 00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,660`
imagined you would like to do



`433 00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,660`
but haven't done yet



`434 00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,660`
since you have done bombs



`435 00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,660`
and you have done crazy physics things



`436 00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,660`
to wreck things



`437 00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,660`
is there anything you feel like



`438 00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,660`
this is the thing I haven't tried yet



`439 00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,660`
yeah there's a few things



`440 00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,660`
not all like straight



`441 00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,660`
destructive things



`442 00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,660`
but kind of interesting effects



`443 00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,660`
I'd like to



`444 00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,660`
that stuff at the end



`445 00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,660`
with the can crushing



`446 00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,660`
I'd be super psyched to



`447 00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,660`
try and do that at scale



`448 00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,660`
and try and do it on something the size



`449 00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,660`
and weight of a full



`450 00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,660`
five and a quarter inch hard disk



`451 00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,660`
I saw a demonstration



`452 00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,660`
I think it was physics girl on youtube



`453 00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,660`
where they took a penny



`454 00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,660`
and they did something straight



`455 00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,660`
magnetic electricity thing



`456 00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,660`
to shrink it



`457 00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,660`
yeah so that same rig



`458 00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,660`
you can also use for shrinking quarters



`459 00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,660`
and we did that also on time warp



`460 00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,660`
as part of that same shoot



`461 00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,660`
and so I have some video of that too



`462 00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,660`
at a really high frame rate



`463 00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,660`
but again it's really hard to see what's going on



`464 00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,660`
because at 100,000 frames per second



`465 00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,660`
it still happens in one frame



`466 00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,660`
and this coin doesn't get a lot smaller



`467 00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,660`
it gets a little bit smaller



`468 00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,660`
so it's not as dramatic as the can crushing



`469 00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,660`
but it's really cool



`470 00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,660`
because no material disappears



`471 00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,660`
the coin gets a smaller diameter



`472 00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,660`
but it gets thicker



`473 00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,660`
because the material stays constant



`474 00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,660`
so you don't think this is the new solution to data compression



`475 00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,660`
if matter is data



`476 00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,660`
there's no compression



`477 00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,660`
same amount of matter is there



`478 00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,660`
but one thing that's cool about that



`479 00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,660`
if you take a euro coin



`480 00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,660`
a bimetallic coin



`481 00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,660`
and you shrink it



`482 00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,660`
they shrink at different rates



`483 00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,660`
it's a problem actually



`484 00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,660`
that I shrunk on a quarter shrinker



`485 00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,660`
and now it's two separate pieces



`486 00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,660`
it would be fun



`487 00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,660`
now they decommissioned the high voltage lab



`488 00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,660`
at Chalmers University



`489 00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,660`
but it would be cool



`490 00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,660`
to get access to that equipment



`491 00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,660`
and see what you can do with a hard drive



`492 00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,660`
and any of these things



`493 00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,660`
are totally accessible to the hobbyists



`494 00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,660`
they're just expensive



`495 00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,660`
buying a big bank of pulse capacitors



`496 00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,660`
there's a fair outlay of cash



`497 00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,660`
to do that



`498 00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,660`
but you can do it



`499 00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,660`
cool



`500 00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,660`
thank you for giving this interview



`501 00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,660`
and have fun at the rest of the conference



`502 00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,660`
thank you



`503 00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,660`
cheers
