`1 00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400`
Så, ge det upp för, vad är det, SecT-podcasten då?



`2 00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:59,980`
Hej då\!



`3 00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:19,000`
Hej då\!



`4 00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:59,980`
Hej då\!



`5 00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:29,980`
Hej då\!



`6 00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:59,980`
Hej då\!



`7 00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:29,980`
Hej då\!



`8 00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:40,000`
Hej då\!



`9 00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000`
Hej då\!



`10 00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:10,000`
Hej då\!



`11 00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:24,000`
Hej då\!



`12 00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000`
Hej då\!



`13 00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,980`
Hej då\!



`14 00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:40,000`
Hej då\!



`15 00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:58,000`
Hej då\!



`16 00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:08,000`
Hej då\!



`17 00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:20,000`
Hej då\!



`18 00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000`
Hej då\!



`19 00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000`
Hej då\!



`20 00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,060`
have a common sense, I mean common sense



`21 00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,480`
is not very common really



`22 00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,280`
especially not in governments



`23 00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,500`
but as long as our research



`24 00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,000`
is open to some extent



`25 00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,960`
and we share our results, we can't really



`26 00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,880`
be expected to



`27 00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,440`
control what people then do with that research



`28 00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,020`
I mean people



`29 00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,300`
will be evil whether they like it or not



`30 00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,980`
so we could either



`31 00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,260`
stop researching new vulnerabilities



`32 00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,180`
or not disclose



`33 00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,180`
our findings which is not a good way to go



`34 00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,020`
either. No but



`35 00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,160`
I still think it's a matter



`36 00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,320`
of being ultra responsible



`37 00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,800`
and



`38 00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,120`
ultra responsible



`39 00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,880`
disclosure, yeah. I mean



`40 00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,300`
it's about



`41 00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,220`
giving the industry



`42 00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,180`
some time. On the other hand you need



`43 00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,240`
to put pressure on them because



`44 00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:14,960`
otherwise



`45 00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,140`
speaking from experience they won't fix



`46 00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,220`
that security vulnerability.



`47 00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,180`
I say ultra responsible



`48 00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,820`
disclosure, that's a way forward when you come



`49 00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:24,140`
to



`50 00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,920`
finding vulnerabilities



`51 00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,800`
and disclosing them to the vendors



`52 00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,220`
but what about exploit development?



`53 00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,940`
Could you sort of morally



`54 00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,820`
defend exploit development



`55 00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,200`
in any scenario? Do you mean as a



`56 00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:36,900`
business model?



`57 00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,140`
Whatever, let's say



`58 00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,100`
you do it for free, let's not



`59 00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,980`
talk about the money, you find a



`60 00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,940`
vulnerability, you produce an exploit



`61 00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,240`
and then you give it



`62 00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,340`
to someone. Let's say



`63 00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,240`
the easy case is like okay you



`64 00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,140`
give, you actually work for the



`65 00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,260`
government or the law enforcement, the local



`66 00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,100`
law enforcement agency and you develop



`67 00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,140`
an exploit for them to be able



`68 00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,320`
to intercept communication from



`69 00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,100`
organized crime. That



`70 00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,240`
seems like a pretty moral good way



`71 00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:06,820`
to go, right?



`72 00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,160`
So, the



`73 00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,060`
interesting part, the beginning part of your kind of



`74 00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,680`
statement was let's forget about the money.



`75 00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,180`
And the problem is, is that



`76 00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,900`
money rules the world around me, right?



`77 00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,160`
Yeah, yeah, of course. And



`78 00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,460`
the people that are advising governments



`79 00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,860`
have a vested



`80 00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,000`
interest in advising



`81 00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,740`
and offensive measures, right?



`82 00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,640`
That we have, you know,



`83 00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,000`
you take road safety



`84 00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,140`
advice from car manufacturers, right?



`85 00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,100`
You take security advice from



`86 00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,660`
weapon manufacturers, right?



`87 00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,160`
It's like polar bears voting



`88 00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,360`
for no carbon emissions,



`89 00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,180`
right? You know, they're not going to



`90 00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,180`
turn around and say the world is



`91 00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,100`
safe. You know, by the way, can we



`92 00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,620`
just have the 50 billion for nothing?



`93 00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,120`
Yeah, yeah, when we come to cyber



`94 00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,040`
warfare,



`95 00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,620`
I'm totally with you. But let's go for



`96 00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,900`
an easier and more down-to-earth example, like



`97 00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,960`
law enforcement agency needing



`98 00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,040`
tools to counter



`99 00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,040`
the advanced



`100 00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,360`
criminals in our society.



`101 00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,920`
But they've always had tools. They've always had



`102 00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,720`
comparison tools. They've intercepted



`103 00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,440`
mails, they've intercepted telephone



`104 00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,440`
communications, they've intercepted wires,



`105 00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,760`
radio transmissions. If we



`106 00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,720`
look throughout history, they've been



`107 00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,660`
at the forefront of intercept. Whatever



`108 00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,880`
the intercept is. Yeah, but let's say



`109 00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,720`
me and my



`110 00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,580`
guys in the terrorist cell seconds



`111 00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,480`
podcast, and we use iMessage



`112 00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,040`
and



`113 00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,200`
Then you're one of the small ones, right?



`114 00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,200`
Yeah, exactly. And now



`115 00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,600`
they want to sort of



`116 00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,460`
the local law enforcement wants to get a hold of



`117 00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,220`
our communications. And without



`118 00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,520`
a good tool to crack the latest



`119 00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,420`
iPhone, they won't get a hold of



`120 00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,400`
our information. No, they'd have to give Apple



`121 00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,480`
a call. Yeah, let's say



`122 00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,660`
Apple is one of the good guys, just for argument's



`123 00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:49,820`
sake.



`124 00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,440`
So, my angle is,



`125 00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,540`
is there a valid



`126 00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,400`
and morally okay



`127 00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,980`
scenario where



`128 00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,540`
exploit development is okay?



`129 00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,440`
So, you're asking if the ends



`130 00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,360`
justify the means?



`131 00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,320`
To some extent. Depends on what you want to do,



`132 00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,980`
what you want to use the exploits for.



`133 00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,040`
Mikes, mikes.



`134 00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,580`
This I really like.



`135 00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,440`
You know, whenever you hear the term



`136 00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,640`
you gotta break some eggs to make an omelette.



`137 00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,600`
It's usually not a



`138 00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,560`
good sign. Turn around and walk away.



`139 00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,200`
Yeah, yeah, yeah.



`140 00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,400`
All right, mikes.



`141 00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,520`
Just out of curiosity,



`142 00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,920`
how do you define morality?



`143 00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,320`
Is it within the nation border or international?



`144 00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,320`
Because different nations kind of define



`145 00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,140`
that differently. Yeah, that's



`146 00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,500`
a very, very good question.



`147 00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,360`
Yeah, and according to Ifyope, I think



`148 00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,380`
it's morally okay to spy



`149 00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,280`
on U.S. journalists.



`150 00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,540`
So, it's



`151 00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,660`
entirely up to



`152 00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,920`
whoever to define what moral is.



`153 00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,300`
Hey, I recognize this is a really



`154 00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,300`
complex issue, but for me, I'm trying to



`155 00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,480`
sort of, to be,



`156 00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,980`
to be able to



`157 00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,340`
sort of, in a



`158 00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,720`
confined space, find



`159 00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,760`
some truth. I'm trying



`160 00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,600`
to look at sort of a local



`161 00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,620`
Swedish problem where perhaps the Swedish



`162 00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,960`
police would like to



`163 00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,700`
do some surveillance of



`164 00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,920`
a local criminal. So I'm



`165 00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,680`
skipping all the cyber and the



`166 00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,660`
United States of Save the World



`167 00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,880`
and all that stuff. I'm just looking at a local



`168 00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,360`
easy problem, like



`169 00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,700`
enhancing, creating better



`170 00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,180`
tools for local law enforcement.



`171 00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:31,760`
And then, of course, when you answer that question, you can go into really complex discussions about the wider moral implications of that one.



`172 00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:32,800`
Another comment?



`173 00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:39,260`
Yeah, well another question is the idea of if it comes to the idea, we start talking about organized crime.



`174 00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:46,800`
And the question is, if you look back at the history of people doing these things in terms of digging into people's privacy,



`175 00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:52,520`
most of it goes into a lot of government policies that were questionable in the first place.



`176 00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,340`
Yeah, foreign policy, right? Foreign policy determines international...



`177 00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,140`
Drug policy.



`178 00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:04,780`
Yeah, foreign policy is international morality. Drug policy is so we didn't have to make the FBI redundant.



`179 00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,080`
Well, the war on drugs.



`180 00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,000`
Yeah, right, okay.



`181 00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:11,820`
We suddenly can justify whatever we need to do because it's the war on drugs.



`182 00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,160`
We've got a war on everything, right?



`183 00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,340`
How's the war going, by the way?



`184 00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,960`
We give up, at least in certain places.



`185 00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,460`
And then we have like in...



`186 00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:32,920`
In Sweden, I think, in the UK as well, that we introduce surveillance to stop organized crime and stop foreign military threats.



`187 00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,660`
And then it turns out that we actually provide some of it to the tax department.



`188 00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:48,020`
And I don't think anyone here ever sat down and agreed to these tools we developed for serious, serious cases.



`189 00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:51,020`
We're now doing it to help...



`190 00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,860`
Get the guys who possibly might be cheating on the tax.



`191 00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,720`
Yeah, let's give all our new exploits to the IRS.



`192 00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,500`
They need all the help they can get.



`193 00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:04,540`
But what I'm hearing from you guys is that, okay, exploit development is never okay?



`194 00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:06,440`
No.



`195 00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,480`
I would disagree.



`196 00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,840`
I get those vibes from you.



`197 00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:21,920`
But so far we have talked about selling exploits to someone who's actually intending to use them for, for example, law enforcement or for something else.



`198 00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,420`
But...



`199 00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:25,660`
Why would you buy an exploit that you weren't going to use?



`200 00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,140`
Exactly.



`201 00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:26,480`
Right?



`202 00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,200`
I mean...



`203 00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:27,220`
Yeah.



`204 00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,240`
But why do you build new bombs?



`205 00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,220`
But I mean, a lot of research has just published.



`206 00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,060`
Because they were planning on using them, like, the minute they weren't looking.



`207 00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,720`
Like, the shield's down.



`208 00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,060`
Go.



`209 00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,080`
Okay.



`210 00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,640`
I'm not going to let this go.



`211 00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,720`
Is it okay to work with exploit development?



`212 00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:49,720`
I can see where it's a valid point to...



`213 00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,200`
To...



`214 00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:51,720`
At least create a...



`215 00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,100`
A proof of concept code.



`216 00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:59,480`
Because you might have to convince company X that has a vulnerable product.



`217 00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:06,200`
And you have to show them that if you do this, in this particular way, things go bad.



`218 00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,100`
POC or GTFO, right?



`219 00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:08,800`
Yeah.



`220 00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:19,740`
So, I mean, it's the one scenario where I personally would create an exploit or an attack tool.



`221 00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:20,640`
Yeah.



`222 00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,740`
I think you got a point there.



`223 00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,660`
Let's look at the FireSheep plug-in.



`224 00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:30,580`
Facebook did nothing to secure their communication to the website until the FireSheep plug-in went live.



`225 00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,820`
And it was very visual.



`226 00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,620`
It was very easy for everyone to understand that this is bad.



`227 00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,500`
That was developed by a friend of mine.



`228 00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:37,640`
Cool.



`229 00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:38,480`
So...



`230 00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,240`
Kudos to your friend.



`231 00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:39,600`
Yeah.



`232 00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:45,660`
And I think the thing is, you've got to remember, it's easy for us to, when we talk about software,



`233 00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,200`
we kind of attach our own personal feelings to it.



`234 00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,180`
Is this good software?



`235 00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,140`
Is this bad software?



`236 00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,220`
Software is amoral.



`237 00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,580`
It's you that is good.



`238 00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,660`
It's you that's bad.



`239 00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,880`
The software is nothing.



`240 00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,740`
And maps are a weapon or a defense, right?



`241 00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,640`
Well, guns don't kill people.



`242 00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,780`
Yeah, we had that analogy in, like, the arms industry.



`243 00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:07,100`
I mean, a weapon, per se, is neither good or bad.



`244 00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,680`
Yeah, it doesn't give a shit about you, right?



`245 00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,920`
But in the end, it is built to shoot someone.



`246 00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:10,780`
Hmm?



`247 00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,640`
It is built to shoot someone.



`248 00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,340`
Yeah, definitely.



`249 00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,260`
You know, my rifles at home, they're made for hunting moose.



`250 00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,620`
Well, yeah, but an M16 isn't.



`251 00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,640`
That's for shooting lots of moose.



`252 00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:33,680`
Another good example of, actually, proof of concept is what is required is



`253 00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,740`
Charlie Miller and Christopher Lessig's hack this summer.



`254 00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,060`
Because we, as a community, we knew cars were hackable.



`255 00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:45,620`
Autosec.org released a paper, like, three or four years ago with the exact same results.



`256 00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,580`
And nothing really happened.



`257 00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:50,600`
The automotive industry started looking into these issues,



`258 00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,520`
but they didn't really do it for real.



`259 00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,860`
There's a lot of movement in the automotive industries right now



`260 00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,600`
after the revelations of Chris and Charlie.



`261 00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,320`
And that's really the point there.



`262 00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:04,240`
You need to create something that's really spectacular



`263 00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:11,420`
in order for the companies with vulnerable products to really do something about it.



`264 00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,540`
Or an entire industry, I think.



`265 00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,580`
We have another question there.



`266 00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,860`
Before the question jumps in, right,



`267 00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:20,280`
what we have to remember with full disclosure,



`268 00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,300`
in particular cases, is the automobile industry had problems beforehand.



`269 00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,660`
And they had reasonable disclosure.



`270 00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:30,540`
And rather than reaching for the developer, they reached for the lawyer.



`271 00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:37,300`
And I think a lot of us could argue that responsible disclosure on paper seems a beautiful thing, right?



`272 00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:40,080`
I'm going to help you help yourself.



`273 00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,840`
But the fact of it is, it's being abused.



`274 00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,480`
So that you've been left with that your only true choice now



`275 00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,440`
is if you reasonably disclose something,



`276 00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,480`
you're likely to get your ass hacked.



`277 00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,900`
You're likely to get your ass handed to you by a legal team.



`278 00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:56,100`
Whereas if you full disclose it, fuck you, we're done.



`279 00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,900`
Right? It's over. You can't silence me now. It's out.



`280 00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,400`
And good luck with your lawyer.



`281 00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,900`
And it's a shame because it shows you how a process that we came up with



`282 00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,900`
as a community to make things better



`283 00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,600`
was abused by a legal structure.



`284 00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:15,400`
And now, literally, we have to say, you know what, we fuck you harder.



`285 00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,600`
That's what we're going to do.



`286 00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,000`
So it's a shaming process, right?



`287 00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,500`
It's moral shaming.



`288 00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,500`
It's shaming people.



`289 00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,500`
But we're the bad guys for it now as well, right?



`290 00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:29,500`
But I mean, I can really relate to that because in a fairly recent,



`291 00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,500`
not so recent, really, situation,



`292 00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,500`
I discovered a vulnerability in a product



`293 00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,500`
and talked to the company about this



`294 00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,000`
and showed them that this is really bad.



`295 00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,500`
You need to do something about it.



`296 00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:48,500`
And I was served with a very long letter from their lawyers



`297 00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,500`
telling me, you know, what they would do



`298 00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,500`
to us if this came out.



`299 00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,500`
You're going to get medieval on your ass, right?



`300 00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,500`
Yes.



`301 00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,500`
What was the question?



`302 00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:01,500`
Well, this is sort of, I'll start off by saying free Kevin.



`303 00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:06,500`
The thing about it is that's part of,



`304 00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,500`
I ended up moving to Sweden about five years ago



`305 00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,500`
and part of my decision about it is if I'm ever going to do security,



`306 00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,500`
I didn't want to do it in the United States



`307 00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,500`
because of the possibility of getting thrown in jail



`308 00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,500`
or getting sued into nothingness.



`309 00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:25,500`
And it's interesting because I had a discussion group



`310 00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,500`
that I have to remain nameless on



`311 00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,500`
that was a bunch of people talking about internet and things



`312 00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,500`
and connected devices.



`313 00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,500`
And I was tossing in the fact that we really needed to worry



`314 00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:40,500`
about the security and building a security standard for IoT devices.



`315 00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,500`
And it was funny because I brought up,



`316 00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,500`
one of the things I brought up was the Malaysian flight.



`317 00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,500`
And the person immediately jumped on me and said,



`318 00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,500`
you're absolutely fucking crazy.



`319 00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,500`
There's no way that a plane can get hacked and this is crap.



`320 00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,500`
And this is about seven or eight months ago.



`321 00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,500`
And so a few weeks ago we had the person arrested in the United States



`322 00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,500`
for hacking the plane.



`323 00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,500`
And I immediately had to send the article to him and say,



`324 00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,500`
okay, so they just arrested somebody for this.



`325 00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,500`
Well, to be fair, he wasn't arrested.



`326 00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,500`
It was questioned, detained at the airport, right?



`327 00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,500`
You're talking about Chris Roberts, right?



`328 00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,500`
And United.



`329 00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,500`
So this is a great infosec drama



`330 00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:28,500`
where the infosec community spins things something chronic.



`331 00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,500`
Chris Roberts did passive sniffing on a plane, right?



`332 00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,500`
Allegedly, sorry Chris, right? Allegedly, right?



`333 00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,500`
But this is man hacks plane and fly sideways, right?



`334 00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,500`
Because it sells.



`335 00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,500`
Full spectrum cyber.



`336 00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,500`
Back to the spectacular.



`337 00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,500`
I mean, people forget that the dude was actually on the plane.



`338 00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,500`
How much do you love your research?



`339 00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,500`
Enough to kill yourself on a plane, right?



`340 00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,500`
But the way that people are talking,



`341 00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,500`
he recklessly endangered lives.



`342 00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,500`
Yes, his, right?



`343 00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,500`
People, we jump to conclusions about this.



`344 00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,500`
It's interesting that you look at the Malaysian Airlines



`345 00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,500`
and think hack.



`346 00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,500`
I've never made that.



`347 00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,500`
I'm not saying hack.



`348 00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,500`
I'm just saying if there's a possibility.



`349 00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,500`
Yeah, I mean.



`350 00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,500`
Of course it is.



`351 00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,500`
What's interesting in security is we are a self-fulfilling prophecy in its own right.



`352 00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:22,500`
So one thing we can guarantee is that planes will be hacked now



`353 00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,500`
because we talked about planes being hacked now.



`354 00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,500`
And this will carry on and perpetuate and perpetuate



`355 00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,500`
until we definitely take a plane out of the sky.



`356 00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,500`
And part of the reason why I went nuts with this guy



`357 00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,500`
is because he said never.



`358 00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,500`
Yeah.



`359 00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,500`
I mean, look at Boeing and their 787, right?



`360 00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:45,500`
They basically had a bug, a counter bug in their software on the planes.



`361 00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,500`
And the fix was you had to reboot your 787.



`362 00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,500`
No shit.



`363 00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:53,500`
Like you had to power the thing down and back up again to reset the counter.



`364 00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:57,500`
These people are building planes that we all fly on, right?



`365 00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,500`
And it's an overflow bug that they've had.



`366 00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,500`
These overflow bugs are pretty old, right?



`367 00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,500`
I'd like to listen to that IT support call.



`368 00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,500`
Actually.



`369 00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,500`
Have you rebooted your 777?



`370 00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,500`
Yeah, have you tried turning it on and off again?



`371 00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:16,500`
Actually, that question was a really good sort of



`372 00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,500`
bridge over to our next question for today.



`373 00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:24,500`
Because we had a question from Olof Lindqvist, Varje sådd, at Twitter.



`374 00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,500`
And he wondered about the future of IT security.



`375 00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,500`
What software and hardware threats do we see in the next five years



`376 00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,500`
or perhaps ten years?



`377 00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,500`
And how do we prepare for them?



`378 00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,500`
The internet of flying things.



`379 00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,500`
Yeah, and that's why I caught on to the question.



`380 00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,500`
It's like internet of things is coming and stuff like that.



`381 00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,500`
So what do we see in the future?



`382 00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,500`
I could just say that I was on a small flight



`383 00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,500`
with a private pilot.



`384 00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:52,500`
And we were listening in to the general air transmissions.



`385 00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,500`
And there was a big airliner



`386 00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:02,500`
who had the problem that their display was black.



`387 00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:07,500`
And that wasn't in any newspaper the day after.



`388 00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:13,500`
So I think there happens a lot more scary shit



`389 00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,500`
than is ever reported.



`390 00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,500`
Because since they resolved it,



`391 00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,500`
they didn't need to do an emergency landing.



`392 00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,500`
They managed to reboot something and copy it.



`393 00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,500`
And they got their IT systems up.



`394 00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,500`
They could continue like nothing happened.



`395 00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,500`
And I'm pretty sure they didn't tell the passengers back



`396 00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,500`
that the pilots were out of instrumentation



`397 00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,500`
and didn't see a shit on their computer.



`398 00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,500`
Because if the screens are black, they have zero instruments.



`399 00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,500`
Because it's all computerized.



`400 00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,500`
I think perhaps Johan, you were right.



`401 00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,500`
It was a call to the IT support department.



`402 00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,500`
So who in here are flying home on Sunday or tomorrow?



`403 00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,500`
Good luck.



`404 00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,500`
Make sure it's Airbus, right?



`405 00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,500`
So, what do we see in the future?



`406 00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:00,500`
Apart from planes with Windows XP screensavers on them?



`407 00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,500`
I see your toaster being a pivot point, right?



`408 00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,500`
Yeah.



`409 00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,500`
I see your toaster being a pivot point.



`410 00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,500`
And then from there on inwards you're getting pwned.



`411 00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,500`
But to be fair, the Internet of Things is just bullshit, right?



`412 00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,500`
Because it's IPv6.



`413 00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,500`
Borderless networking.



`414 00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,500`
I mean, this is what it boils down to.



`415 00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,500`
I mean, this is probably why we'll colonize Mars



`416 00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,500`
so we can finally have a planet that's IPv6.



`417 00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,500`
But, I mean, this is the concept.



`418 00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,500`
Nothing has a border.



`419 00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,500`
So it doesn't make a difference if it's a toaster or a computer, right?



`420 00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,500`
I mean, that's the whole idea.



`421 00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,500`
We have so many IP addresses that we'll be able to connect to.



`422 00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,500`
So, you know, those that have got their head around,



`423 00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,500`
there is no borders, there is no perimeter and external



`424 00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,500`
so on and so forth in networking.



`425 00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:50,500`
We'll have a better time than people who are still building walls



`426 00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,500`
as a defense mechanism.



`427 00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,500`
You know, this was good in the medieval times in Rome and so on and so forth.



`428 00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,500`
Bit shitty in our tech world.



`429 00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,500`
We're just going to build a wall.



`430 00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,500`
And everything on the outside of this wall is a bad guy.



`431 00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,500`
And everything on the inside of this is a good guy.



`432 00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,500`
It's armadillo of security.



`433 00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,500`
So those that get their head around this probably won't have a bad time.



`434 00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,500`
Those that don't will probably die.



`435 00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:15,500`
I do think that the IT support market will be exploding soon.



`436 00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:19,500`
I mean, I'll have to do firmware updates for my fridge in the near future.



`437 00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,500`
And I just see how many ways that can go wrong.



`438 00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,500`
Hey, I do firmware updates with my furnace.



`439 00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,500`
Yeah, today.



`440 00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:31,500`
I'm looking forward to patch Tuesday for your home.



`441 00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:35,500`
But if you look at that, throwing away the borders,



`442 00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,500`
IPv6 for everyone, a lot of possibility to



`443 00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,500`
connect to all the things.



`444 00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:48,500`
With what we see today from an embedded software development perspective,



`445 00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,500`
I would say there's going to be a lot worse when it comes to



`446 00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:55,500`
exploitable software and hardware because they aren't ready.



`447 00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,500`
The embedded software I've seen is really, really bad.



`448 00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,500`
Nothing's changed, right?



`449 00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,500`
I mean, we've been talking about inputting,



`450 00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,500`
sanitizing input for God knows how long.



`451 00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,500`
I mean, at some point we have to look at it as an industry and say we suck.



`452 00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,500`
Because we've talked about this.



`453 00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,500`
We've even got OWASP, right?



`454 00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,500`
And we still have SQLI, right?



`455 00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,500`
We still have this going on.



`456 00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,500`
At some point, you're going to have to look in the mirror and say,



`457 00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,500`
maybe it's not the developers.



`458 00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,500`
Maybe it's us that can't convey the message.



`459 00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,500`
Definitely true.



`460 00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,500`
There is a problem here.



`461 00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,500`
So, you know, all we're doing is just moving the attack surface.



`462 00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,500`
It's going to be the same attacks.



`463 00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:37,500`
I mean, look at what we're about to see with ICMP.



`464 00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,500`
All the, like, IPv6,



`465 00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,500`
and ICMP with 4,



`466 00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:44,500`
we turned off ping attacks and ping tunnels and so on and so forth.



`467 00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,500`
We didn't mitigate the problem.



`468 00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,500`
We turned it off.



`469 00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,500`
And guess what?



`470 00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,500`
We can't do half of those defense mode processes in IPv6.



`471 00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,500`
So guess what?



`472 00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,500`
We just put off a technical debt.



`473 00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,500`
That's all we did.



`474 00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,500`
So everything that's old will be shiny again, right?



`475 00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,500`
Yeah.



`476 00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,500`
That's sort of a process we've seen before.



`477 00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,500`
So let's go back to the good old days



`478 00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,500`
when we put computers on the internet for the first time.



`479 00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,500`
And then we solved those problems.



`480 00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,500`
More or less.



`481 00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,500`
And then we put phones on the internet.



`482 00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,500`
And then we got the same problems.



`483 00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,500`
And now we're trying to solve them.



`484 00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:19,500`
And now we're putting small, tiny, embedded devices with Linux.



`485 00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,500`
Bad configured Linux.



`486 00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,500`
And we have that same problem all over again.



`487 00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,500`
And cars.



`488 00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,500`
And airplanes.



`489 00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:30,500`
I'm not so worried about refrigerators and toasters being connected to the internet.



`490 00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,500`
I'm slightly worried about tanks.



`491 00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,500`
And you laugh, right?



`492 00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,500`
I swear to God there is a tank with an internet connection.



`493 00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,500`
Right?



`494 00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,500`
There's a gun with an internet connection.



`495 00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,500`
Yeah, right.



`496 00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,500`
Okay, cool.



`497 00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:47,500`
That sounds like an interesting project to hack a tank.



`498 00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:51,500`
At what point in that board meeting do you go,



`499 00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,500`
we should totally connect this thing, right?



`500 00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,500`
It would be fucking awesome.



`501 00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,500`
If we can just buy a shit remotely.



`502 00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,500`
At what point do you all agree?



`503 00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,500`
It's a unique selling point, right?



`504 00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,500`
I like this assault rifle, but is it Wi-Fi-enabled?



`505 00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,500`
Can I update my status?



`506 00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:12,500`
To connect back to yesterday's presentation,



`507 00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:18,500`
they talked about security issues in the FIS,



`508 00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,500`
the physical internet.



`509 00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:25,500`
And the NCC group published a month or so ago



`510 00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:31,500`
attacks where they attack the DAB radio and attack cars.



`511 00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:36,500`
And they owned the infotainment systems over the radio.



`512 00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:42,500`
So we're actually, in exception to the attack surfaces



`513 00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,500`
we're intentionally putting there,



`514 00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:48,500`
we also got unintentional attack surface there.



`515 00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,500`
An intentional attack surface.



`516 00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,500`
Introducing new attack vectors.



`517 00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,500`
That's pretty awesome.



`518 00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:58,500`
We actually have an episode on odd attack vectors.



`519 00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:02,500`
It's a really old program, so we should probably do a new one.



`520 00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,500`
An update.



`521 00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,500`
Yeah, I think there's been a few more surfaces since we recorded that one.



`522 00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,500`
Definitely.



`523 00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:11,500`
Actually, I just felt that hacking cars is sort of getting old.



`524 00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,500`
Tanks?



`525 00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,500`
Tanks?



`526 00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,500`
You're like the epitaph of retro hacker there.



`527 00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,500`
I mean, hacking cars is pretty cool, right?



`528 00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,500`
But that's so like six months ago.



`529 00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,500`
So like August.



`530 00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:27,500`
I mean, I like the original when we hack submarines, right?



`531 00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,500`
That's cool.



`532 00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,500`
I'm going for tanks next.



`533 00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,500`
And I think it's funny, but when we saw Terminator 3



`534 00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:36,500`
we all thought that was a stupid sucky movie.



`535 00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,500`
You saw Terminator 3?



`536 00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:44,500`
Yeah, and it was so unrealistic with all the cars being hacked remotely



`537 00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,500`
and starting to attack the humans.



`538 00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:50,500`
And now it doesn't feel so remote anymore.



`539 00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,500`
Well, yeah, life imitating art.



`540 00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,500`
Just look at Star Trek for that, right?



`541 00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,500`
We can blame Kirk and Picard.



`542 00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:02,500`
What's that other movie where the trucks sort of attack humans?



`543 00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,500`
Transformers?



`544 00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,500`
Maximum Overdrive or something like that.



`545 00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,500`
I think it's a Stephen King movie or something, right?



`546 00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,500`
Yeah.



`547 00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,500`
Yeah, I'm seeing that future.



`548 00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:17,500`
I think that book was written during Stephen Kings cocaine years.



`549 00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,500`
Okay.



`550 00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,500`
So, anything else?



`551 00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,500`
If we're looking like 10 years...



`552 00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,500`
Do we have a question?



`553 00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,500`
I think we have a question from the audience here.



`554 00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,500`
One question.



`555 00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,500`
When we look at the general trends the recent years



`556 00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,500`
we see that there's been a shift towards...



`557 00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:36,500`
from general computing towards locked-in devices on iPads and stuff like that.



`558 00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:41,500`
And the sophistication level of how these devices are locked is increasing all the time



`559 00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:44,500`
and it gets more difficult to break.



`560 00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,500`
There are HSM chips and everything.



`561 00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,500`
So, what do you think about the future in that sense?



`562 00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:56,500`
Will there be an iPad that won't be jailbroken?



`563 00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,500`
And what are the consequences of this trend?



`564 00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,500`
Well, everything can get hacked.



`565 00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,500`
But as you say, it's been more and more difficult



`566 00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,500`
to actually jailbreak an iDevice.



`567 00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:10,500`
And there are fewer and fewer exploit developers



`568 00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:14,500`
that have the competencies to be able to exploit those.



`569 00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,500`
I don't think we'll ever see an unhackable device



`570 00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,500`
but perhaps it will be that hard



`571 00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:25,500`
that there won't be any public ways to jailbreak a device.



`572 00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,500`
It's cost-benefit, right?



`573 00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,500`
Yeah, yeah.



`574 00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,500`
Nobody is interested in...



`575 00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:33,500`
Let's say, nobody...



`576 00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:37,500`
No civilian will be interested in paying that much money



`577 00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,500`
to develop an exploit for...



`578 00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,500`
What I would say to this, right,



`579 00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,500`
is that remember that we used to have this kind of mantra



`580 00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,500`
that the only safe computer was a disconnected computer.



`581 00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,500`
Do you remember when we had this as a mindset?



`582 00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,500`
Air gap all the things.



`583 00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,500`
And then the fuckers went and fucked that too.



`584 00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:59,500`
So even now, an unplugged device is not necessarily so safe.



`585 00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,500`
Take the sound card out, right?



`586 00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,500`
That's where we're at next.



`587 00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,500`
And what will happen from there on inwards?



`588 00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,500`
So, yeah, I'm with you on the unhackable...



`589 00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,500`
The only thing that's unhackable is unhackable, right?



`590 00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:14,500`
I mean, I kind of get that you can't fix anything.



`591 00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:17,500`
But yeah, I mean, like I say, who would have thought 10 years ago



`592 00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,500`
that air gapping not only would be there



`593 00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:23,500`
but it would be readily available to most people



`594 00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,500`
that can use Google?



`595 00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,500`
It's mind-blowing in some ways.



`596 00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,500`
It's about sort of malicious firmware in hard drives



`597 00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,500`
and malicious UEFI BIOS stuff.



`598 00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,500`
It scares the hell out of me.



`599 00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:39,500`
Yeah, it's like you can't trust hardware anymore.



`600 00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,500`
No, no, no, you have to build your computer yourself



`601 00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,500`
from transistors.



`602 00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,500`
Trust no one and nothing.



`603 00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:50,500`
And I think the most common trust zone implementation



`604 00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:58,500`
is the QSC operating system for ARM trust zones.



`605 00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:05,500`
And there's four presentations on people actually succeeding



`606 00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,500`
in hacking those.



`607 00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:12,500`
And my understanding is that once you actually get root



`608 00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:16,500`
on a Linux system and can start talking to a trust zone



`609 00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,500`
and issue commands to that,



`610 00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:23,500`
the trust zone operating system actually has less modern security features



`611 00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:27,500`
than the Linux system you already have succeeded in attacking



`612 00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:32,500`
to getting to the point that you can start attacking the trust zone.



`613 00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:36,500`
And to get back to the question,



`614 00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,500`
I think that the development we will see



`615 00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:45,500`
is that more devices will get more efficient tools



`616 00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,500`
to make exploits harder.



`617 00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:51,500`
We will see the same development that we have seen with AI devices.



`618 00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,500`
We will see those in Android field as well.



`619 00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:56,500`
And we will see those in the embedded field as well.



`620 00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,500`
So things will get better and better.



`621 00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,500`
But then we are so creative in this world



`622 00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:04,500`
that we always create new types of tools.



`623 00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:08,500`
And those will not have these fancy features.



`624 00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,500`
So they will in turn be exploitable instead.



`625 00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:15,500`
So even if the old stuff will be hard to hack,



`626 00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,500`
there will always be new gadgets that we can hack.



`627 00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:21,500`
The toasters, the fridges, the planes.



`628 00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,500`
And the tanks.



`629 00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,500`
The tanks.



`630 00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,500`
And as a counter to that,



`631 00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:32,500`
I think since the consumer market



`632 00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:35,500`
is pushing for more and more connected devices



`633 00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,500`
and more and more gadgets.



`634 00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,500`
We are talking about wearables and things like that.



`635 00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:44,500`
The marketing departments and the tech departments



`636 00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:49,500`
will have a huge drive to come out with new features.



`637 00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:53,500`
And those will be customer oriented features,



`638 00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,500`
not security features.



`639 00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:59,500`
So I think there is still going to be



`640 00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,500`
so much new technology coming in



`641 00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:06,500`
with the same vulnerabilities we looked at 10 years ago.



`642 00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,500`
That will be introduced.



`643 00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:11,500`
And they will become the pivot point that you,



`644 00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,500`
like you say the pivot point is the toaster,



`645 00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,500`
that you can use to get a foothold



`646 00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,500`
and then hack the secure systems.



`647 00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,500`
Because they will be connected via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi or whatever.



`648 00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,500`
So we need support.



`649 00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,500`
I have a question just over there.



`650 00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,500`
Yeah, it's quite easy question I think.



`651 00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,500`
We'll tell you afterwards.



`652 00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,500`
Yeah, if you could just talk a bit about it.



`653 00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,500`
How do you see risk and possibilities



`654 00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:37,500`
in creating botnets in Internet of Things?



`655 00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,500`
Great.



`656 00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,500`
Depending on your viewpoint.



`657 00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:47,500`
Yeah, I've seen a couple of papers already like 2-3 years ago



`658 00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:52,500`
regarding really successful botnet creation from meshed



`659 00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,500`
Internet of Things devices.



`660 00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,500`
So it's...



`661 00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,500`
Yeah, I would say there are great possibilities.



`662 00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,500`
The more Internet-connected things you have,



`663 00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,500`
the higher likely, right?



`664 00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,500`
Yeah.



`665 00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,500`
I would say very likely.



`666 00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:11,500`
Wasn't it the Internet Census paper or something



`667 00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:14,500`
where they claimed that the data was produced



`668 00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:18,500`
from hacked routers?



`669 00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,500`
So you already have this,



`670 00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,500`
that non-computer device,



`671 00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,500`
non-computer devices are being hacked



`672 00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,500`
at a pretty large scale.



`673 00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:31,500`
And they also said that they found other malwares



`674 00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,500`
on some of the routers.



`675 00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,500`
So, I mean, it's already happening.



`676 00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:40,500`
Let's say Shordan is a really scary tool.



`677 00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,500`
Beautiful tool.



`678 00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,500`
So do we have any more questions



`679 00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,500`
from you lovely people in the audience?



`680 00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,500`
Don't be shy.



`681 00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,500`
We'll just point at you in a minute, right?



`682 00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,500`
Yeah.



`683 00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,500`
Are you still hungover from last night?



`684 00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,500`
Some of us on the stage are.



`685 00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,500`
A little bit.



`686 00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,500`
I've got a question for us all.



`687 00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,500`
We talked about this yesterday.



`688 00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,500`
Jester, hero or villain?



`689 00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,500`
It's connected to the other discusses.



`690 00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,500`
The jester, hero or villain?



`691 00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,500`
So what do you say?



`692 00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,500`
Let's go from left to right.



`693 00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:18,500`
I'm not sure, but he is entertaining.



`694 00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,500`
Once again?



`695 00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,500`
He's entertaining at least.



`696 00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:25,500`
I don't know, it's really tough to answer actually



`697 00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,500`
because he's doing some good stuff



`698 00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,500`
and some really weird stuff as well.



`699 00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,500`
So it's not black and white, I'd say.



`700 00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,500`
It's a lot of patriotism, isn't it?



`701 00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,500`
It's like bald eagles are flying.



`702 00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,500`
Yeah.



`703 00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,500`
It's a lot of America.



`704 00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,500`
Alleged.



`705 00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,500`
I'm going to go for villain.



`706 00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,500`
I'm going to go for like the super villain



`707 00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,500`
but he's actually quite a cool guy.



`708 00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,500`
Super villain like Bond villain?



`709 00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:54,500`
No, more like Doctor Evil, I guess.



`710 00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,500`
Secret Lair.



`711 00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,500`
Yeah, that kind of evil.



`712 00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,500`
I would say prankster



`713 00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,500`
because my understanding is that



`714 00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:05,500`
apparently he does some stuff



`715 00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,500`
but he has also been very efficient at



`716 00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:11,500`
looking out for when sites will go down



`717 00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,500`
for expiring DNS's etc.



`718 00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,500`
and has published tango down



`719 00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,500`
the minute they go down.



`720 00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:20,500`
So he's a very clever guy



`721 00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:24,500`
at creating PR for stuff he didn't do.



`722 00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,500`
Although I'm sure someone will correct me



`723 00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,500`
and name quite a lot of things he has actually done.



`724 00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,500`
But some of it is just pranks



`725 00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,500`
where he takes credit for



`726 00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,500`
natural occurring events on the internet.



`727 00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,500`
Yeah, I sort of agree with you, Peter.



`728 00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,500`
I think he's an internet troll, mainly.



`729 00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,500`
He's an amusing internet troll



`730 00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,500`
and especially when he attacks



`731 00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,500`
the Westboro Baptist Church.



`732 00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,500`
I really love him.



`733 00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,500`
Yeah, I can't agree more.



`734 00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,500`
I would say an internet troll.



`735 00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,500`
So for me, it's interesting because



`736 00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:59,500`
how we determine if he's a hero or a villain



`737 00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,500`
is the victims of his crime, right?



`738 00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,500`
Those that are deserving and those that are not.



`739 00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,500`
So we're all cool with the Baptist Church



`740 00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,500`
getting pwned, right?



`741 00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,500`
Because, hey, you're a bunch of assholes.



`742 00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,500`
And then we've got no sympathy.



`743 00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,500`
But if we look at other targets,



`744 00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,500`
we can, you know,



`745 00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,500`
if you change the target face,



`746 00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,500`
we suddenly have different attachments to it.



`747 00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,500`
The problem is that he's, you know,



`748 00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,500`
a judge, you're an executioner himself.



`749 00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,500`
Kan't buy versus Indians.



`750 00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,500`
And we're really back to where we started



`751 00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,500`
with the morality and the background.



`752 00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,500`
It depends.



`753 00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,500`
It shouldn't really, but yeah.



`754 00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:39,500`
You would think as a bunch of



`755 00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,500`
computer-orientated people



`756 00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,500`
we would be far more black and white



`757 00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,500`
and not so grey.



`758 00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,500`
But it is.



`759 00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,500`
For me it's always,



`760 00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,500`
like an example,



`761 00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,500`
we hop back to the Chris Roberts stuff, right?



`762 00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:53,500`
So, you know, Chris Roberts passively,



`763 00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,500`
so let me explain it this way.



`764 00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,500`
Someone who passively intercepts packets on a network,



`765 00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:01,500`
someone who arbitrarily executes code



`766 00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,500`
on someone else's property,



`767 00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,500`
which would we decide is the worst?



`768 00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,500`
In that argument being framed that way,



`769 00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,500`
we would say the person that executes code arbitrarily



`770 00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,500`
on someone else's property without their permission.



`771 00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,500`
Now I tell you,



`772 00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,500`
the people that are having that code executed



`773 00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,500`
on their property are Wi-Fi pineapple,



`774 00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,500`
the pineapple users and their skiddies.



`775 00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,500`
And then all of a sudden people are like,



`776 00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,500`
oh, that's so funny.



`777 00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,500`
It's Lee, it's Lowell, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.



`778 00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,500`
So the minute that we change the face of the victim



`779 00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:33,500`
is the minute that we change the crime.



`780 00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,500`
It's really interesting to kind of look at it



`781 00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,500`
in that context.



`782 00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,500`
And, you know, kind of like the hacking back,



`783 00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:42,500`
I mean, is it okay to hack back?



`784 00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,500`
That's very interesting.



`785 00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,500`
That's, again, you know,



`786 00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:48,500`
who's on the other side of that system?



`787 00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,500`
Yeah, I mean, if you're throwing packets in vain,



`788 00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,500`
we'd like to think if you're throwing packets in vain,



`789 00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,500`
then all's fair and good, right?



`790 00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,500`
I mean, if you haven't thrown a packet in vain,



`791 00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,500`
then you're not hacking.



`792 00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:01,500`
But, yeah, I mean, I'd agree.



`793 00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,500`
And let's say you're hacking back,



`794 00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,500`
you could actually be attacking the police.



`795 00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,500`
Yes.



`796 00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,500`
And with that, I think we're done.



`797 00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,500`
Yeah, it's time to wrap up, I think.



`798 00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,500`
It's time for a wrap.



`799 00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,500`
You go for that?



`800 00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,500`
Yeah.



`801 00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,500`
Well, it's been really great



`802 00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,500`
standing here talking in front of you all,



`803 00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,500`
even though I am terribly hungover.



`804 00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,500`
I hope you guys enjoyed it



`805 00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,500`
as much as we did on stage, I'm sure.



`806 00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:27,500`
And just to let you know,



`807 00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,500`
we do have some t-shirts up here on stage,



`808 00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,500`
so if you want them,



`809 00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,500`
I mean, there's not too many left,



`810 00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,500`
but run up here and grab one,



`811 00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,500`
you know, first come, first served.



`812 00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,500`
Yeah.



`813 00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,500`
And anything else, guys, we want to add?



`814 00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,500`
All right.



`815 00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,500`
I said this yesterday, but, like,



`816 00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,500`
you guys have been cool,



`817 00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,500`
but a big round of applause for the SEC team,



`818 00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,500`
volunteers for doing such a great job as well.



`819 00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,500`
Oh, yeah, really.



`820 00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,500`
Bye, guys.



`821 00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,500`
All right, see you guys later.



`822 00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,500`
Thanks.



`823 00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,500`
Thanks.



`824 00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,500`
All right, thank you very much.
