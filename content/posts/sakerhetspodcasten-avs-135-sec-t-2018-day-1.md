## AI transkribering

_AI försöker förstå oss... Ha överseende med galna feltranskriberingar._

`1 00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,120`
Ja, vi rekryterar och nivåerna ser bra ut.



`2 00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:42,640`
Och den här gången kallade nån Ericsson och inom 5 minuter hittade vi en publikt utsläppad remote desktop till en Windows XP-machin.



`3 00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,560`
Och på den tiden tänkte man att det inte skulle bli bättre än det.



`4 00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:52,400`
För på den tiden tänkte man att man ska använda sin imagination och se vad som händer.



`5 00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,800`
Varför? Varför är det online?



`6 00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,800`
Det är skrämmande.



`7 00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,800`
Välkomna till internet, jag ska vara din guider.



`8 00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,920`
Jag hoppas att du har det bra.



`9 00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,920`
Jag har en hälsa.



`10 00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,720`
Så för dem som inte har tittat på din berättelse så ska du gå till Säkti och titta på den.



`11 00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,720`
Men låt oss sammanfatta.



`12 00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,520`
Så du har gjort det på grund av att vi gör det fel?



`13 00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:19,120`
För att vara mer speciell så gör jag det på grund av att stora organisationer som har upplevt gigantiska publika utsläpp



`14 00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:27,040`
inte är nödvändiga för säkerhetsposturen i deras organisation.



`15 00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,040`
De behandlar det som ett PR-problem.



`16 00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,520`
De behandlar det som ett PR-problem.



`17 00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,520`
De behandlar det som ett PR-problem.



`18 00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,520`
De behandlar det som ett PR-problem.



`19 00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,520`
Så jag har en person som kom in och sa att jag sa ingenting åt det.



`20 00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,520`
Jag pratar om hans gig och han är på stundet.



`21 00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,520`
Ja, och världen är så stor.



`22 00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,520`
Särskilt för säkerhetens ord.



`23 00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,520`
Ja, och han sa tack för alla de uppföljelser.



`24 00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,520`
Men du gjorde det rätt.



`25 00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,520`
Det finns demonstrerande evidens som visar att de hade ett breach och gjorde lite.



`26 00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,520`
Och nu är perimetret effektivt en ställning och jag kunde inte hitta något.



`27 00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,520`
Jag kan inte...



`28 00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,520`
Om du går in i Ashley Madison så gör du inget lättare.



`29 00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,520`
Du kommer in där man har en tillbyggnad.



`30 00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:07,520`
Men det är en väldigt intressant sak. Jag pratar om ett företag i ett positivt ljus, och han är i publiken.



`31 00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:14,520`
Jag trodde inte att jag skulle säga det, men jag skulle gärna vara Ashley Madisons person nu.



`32 00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,520`
Än Ericssons person.



`33 00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:24,520`
Det är så olyckligt hur det här skiljer sig ut. Man kan inte förvänta sig det.



`34 00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:29,520`
En stor entreprenad har en enorm pyramide.



`35 00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:42,520`
Vi tog Ericsson som exempel. De har en bra avgörande av alla basband eller mobila celler och routrar.



`36 00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,520`
Fingerprinten borde vara stor.



`37 00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:52,520`
Jag tror att det är samma sak för sjukvården och medicinska utrustning.



`38 00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,520`
Ja.



`39 00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,520`
Ja.



`40 00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,520`
Det är lite laggande.



`41 00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,520`
Ja.



`42 00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:01,520`
Vi har pratat med flera kliniker och sjukvårdshospital.



`43 00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,520`
De försöker få dem att köpa säkerhetsservicer från oss.



`44 00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,520`
De säger att de inte är intresserade.



`45 00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:16,520`
De är, åtminstone de som vi har pratat med, av opinionen att de gör vad reglerna befrågar.



`46 00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:22,520`
De känner inte att de måste gå över och över eller göra något mer än vad de är omedvetna om.



`47 00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,520`
Det är så de uttrycker det.



`48 00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,520`
Det är den växande sättet de uttrycker det.



`49 00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,520`
Den växande sättet är att de gör vad som är legalt bara för att kunna göra affärer.



`50 00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,520`
Ja.



`51 00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,520`
Och det är det.



`52 00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,520`
De gör vad som är legalt bara för att kunna göra affärer.



`53 00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,520`
Och de inte har en ansvarighet.



`54 00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,520`
Nej.



`55 00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,520`
Och till det slutet säger de att de inte är intresserade.



`56 00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,520`
De har insjön.



`57 00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,520`
Så det finns folk som dör i ditt sjukvård.



`58 00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,520`
Ja, exakt.



`59 00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,520`
Om ditt sjukvård blir utnyttjat och om du har Wannacry installerat i ditt hem.



`60 00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,520`
Ja.



`61 00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,520`
Vi hade en sån incidens.



`62 00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,520`
Det var nog i Chicago, eller hur?



`63 00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,520`
Helt sjukvårdskanalen hade att sluta.



`64 00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,800`
Ransomware in the control systems



`65 00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,440`
for like medical stuff



`66 00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,060`
so people get their treatment



`67 00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,620`
and what's worse is



`68 00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,840`
because that ransomware campaign was successful



`69 00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,780`
and they pay the ransom



`70 00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,720`
all the other ransomware people went oh they pay



`71 00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,520`
and started infecting everybody



`72 00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,640`
and then now what you have is you have



`73 00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,480`
people that are buying bitcoin, laughably



`74 00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,640`
buying like several thousand dollars



`75 00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,900`
in bitcoin and setting it aside



`76 00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,420`
in case they get ransomwared, that's their



`77 00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,480`
solution, the solution isn't like fixed



`78 00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,740`
security and like patch stuff so we don't get ransomware



`79 00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,480`
the solution is just pay the ransom



`80 00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,900`
and it's like



`81 00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,040`
you're, oh my god



`82 00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,320`
you're trying to put the fire out with kerosene



`83 00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,220`
and it's not working



`84 00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:30,200`
so what should we do



`85 00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,520`
in your opinion, what should large corporations do



`86 00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,460`
everyone should be a little bit more like Ashley Madison



`87 00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,740`
yeah, for sure



`88 00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,640`
so there's several different schools



`89 00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,640`
of thought here and sadly there is not one



`90 00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,580`
sort of one size fits all solution for everyone



`91 00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,560`
in almost



`92 00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,560`
every circumstance



`93 00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,440`
the problems that we see like we saw



`94 00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,200`
at Ericsson and like we saw at Equifax



`95 00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,120`
and at BA



`96 00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,620`
they're the results



`97 00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,460`
of years and years and years of



`98 00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,960`
neglect and technical debt



`99 00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,320`
so what you end up is some system



`100 00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,580`
running on some super ancient blah blah blah



`101 00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,320`
and the license



`102 00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,260`
says that it's only allowed to run



`103 00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,200`
on Windows XP version blah



`104 00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,480`
so the only option you have



`105 00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,500`
is to like P2V the whole machine



`106 00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,720`
like turn it into a virtual machine



`107 00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,540`
but in some circumstances you can't do that



`108 00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,000`
because that machine is your MRI machine



`109 00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,900`
for example, like you can't P2V an MRI machine



`110 00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,740`
or in worse circumstances



`111 00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,420`
you have an MRI machine or a CT scan



`112 00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,080`
or some big 20 million dollar device



`113 00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,880`
and it's got embedded Windows XP



`114 00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,500`
or embedded Windows CE or some garbage like that



`115 00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,300`
and the manufacturer



`116 00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,160`
goes out of business



`117 00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,120`
and because of certain types of medical rules



`118 00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,040`
like you can't just



`119 00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,360`
reverse engineer the driver that talks



`120 00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,260`
to the machine and stick it on an Ubuntu



`121 00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,900`
machine and make life easier for everyone



`122 00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,320`
because it's no longer compliant



`123 00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,260`
you can't just fix it



`124 00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,160`
because the law says you're not allowed



`125 00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,660`
the law says you can patch stuff



`126 00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,880`
and even then it's really interesting



`127 00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,720`
because a lot of people in the medical field



`128 00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,420`
believe that you can't patch because HIPAA



`129 00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,620`
and that's completely incorrect



`130 00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,500`
you can patch and you can upgrade machines



`131 00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,780`
but you can't like there's some language



`132 00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,000`
regarding being able to forklift something



`133 00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,260`
onto a completely new operating system



`134 00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,360`
that has not been tested in the same ways



`135 00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,080`
as like so if you have a machine



`136 00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,740`
and it's like you know Windows Server 2008



`137 00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,420`
and you want to upgrade it to Windows Server 2012



`138 00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,620`
like it is reasonable to say



`139 00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,020`
that you can forklift all the configurations



`140 00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,020`
and everything from one to the other



`141 00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:20,860`
and then there's a paper trail



`142 00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,120`
that supports everything and you're okay



`143 00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,980`
but like you can't just forklift it to Ubuntu



`144 00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,700`
because the rules don't like



`145 00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,520`
there's no like a gold standard



`146 00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,120`
or gold image for that operating system



`147 00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,860`
or something to that effect



`148 00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,000`
but you still have the problem



`149 00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,680`
in Ubuntu though



`150 00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,880`
you need your hardening



`151 00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,020`
you need to take care of your technical depth



`152 00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,000`
in Ubuntu as well



`153 00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,160`
but the difference is that



`154 00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,780`
it's a lot easier to take care of



`155 00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,080`
on an operating system



`156 00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,480`
that is currently being supported



`157 00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,780`
by a company and a community



`158 00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,780`
but if you're running on Windows XP for example



`159 00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,480`
XP is no longer supported by Microsoft



`160 00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,460`
and it's proprietary



`161 00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,220`
so is that a responsibility thing



`162 00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,420`
that people don't want to be on



`163 00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,020`
for anything going wrong



`164 00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,300`
when you're moving stuff



`165 00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,000`
what I have seen



`166 00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,680`
is at the executive and leadership levels



`167 00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,220`
the people that



`168 00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,040`
in certain circumstances



`169 00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,640`
and this is one of the things I've noticed



`170 00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,740`
this is a symptom of high turnover



`171 00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,960`
of executives and leadership



`172 00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,880`
that are responsible



`173 00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,580`
for IT and security



`174 00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,660`
the sad noir reality



`175 00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,180`
like the cold hard facts



`176 00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,940`
are that generally



`177 00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,360`
like by volume



`178 00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,000`
the people that are in charge of technology



`179 00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,460`
and the people that are in charge of security



`180 00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,500`
they brag to their friends



`181 00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,580`
about not reading email



`182 00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,100`
they say that their kids know more



`183 00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,560`
about computers than they do



`184 00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,380`
and it's like



`185 00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,840`
why are they allowed to be in charge



`186 00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,760`
of technology and security



`187 00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,860`
if they brag about not using it



`188 00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:39,880`
like they're the worst



`189 00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,200`
like the worst possible choice



`190 00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,460`
of people to have in that position



`191 00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,520`
so what they do is



`192 00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:44,860`
they don't know how to use it



`193 00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,820`
they don't know what they're doing



`194 00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,660`
so they do their best



`195 00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,780`
to fly by the seat of their pants



`196 00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,080`
and it's all smoke and mirrors and bullshit



`197 00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,100`
for two years



`198 00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,280`
until they switch jobs



`199 00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,820`
and then another person comes in



`200 00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,480`
and it's the same thing



`201 00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,700`
so the people that are supposed to be



`202 00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,560`
making the hard decisions



`203 00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,480`
the people that are supposed to be



`204 00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,140`
defining budgets



`205 00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:57,940`
to decide what to do



`206 00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:58,580`
and how to move forward



`207 00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,800`
are doing whatever they can



`208 00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,620`
to obfuscate



`209 00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,060`
that they're not actually doing anything



`210 00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,000`
and they hang out



`211 00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,620`
and they get their bonuses



`212 00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,280`
and they get their money



`213 00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:04,880`
and then they leave



`214 00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,240`
and then the next person comes in



`215 00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,040`
and it's the same thing



`216 00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,460`
they hang out



`217 00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,100`
and they're like



`218 00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,960`
oh I've inherited a dumpster fire



`219 00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,380`
I don't want to deal with this



`220 00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,380`
I'm just going to make excuses



`221 00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,080`
and make delays



`222 00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,040`
and cause problems



`223 00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,720`
and fire people



`224 00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,500`
and change departments



`225 00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,420`
and it's a shell game



`226 00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,700`
until they leave



`227 00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,680`
and they stay for two years



`228 00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,340`
they take their bonus



`229 00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:20,800`
and they leave



`230 00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,540`
and they just do that



`231 00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,200`
over and over and over



`232 00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:22,800`
and over and over again



`233 00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,900`
and that's one of the symptoms



`234 00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,880`
that we're



`235 00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,720`
the symptoms



`236 00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,340`
that we're experiencing



`237 00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,980`
are all of these hacks



`238 00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:29,920`
and the reason that



`239 00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,640`
this is the case



`240 00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,500`
is because we continue



`241 00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,200`
to allow people



`242 00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,940`
that probably shouldn't be allowed



`243 00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,680`
to touch computers



`244 00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,320`
in the first place



`245 00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,920`
to be in charge of computers



`246 00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,560`
and computer networks



`247 00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,860`
and their subsequent security



`248 00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,300`
and it's just mind-boggling



`249 00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,540`
I think that's



`250 00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:42,900`
a



`251 00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,060`
a



`252 00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:43,980`
probably a good way



`253 00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,540`
to sum it up



`254 00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,000`
yeah



`255 00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,900`
and that's just one segment of it



`256 00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,100`
there's other components



`257 00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:48,740`
where you'll have



`258 00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:49,520`
people like



`259 00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,320`
a former boss



`260 00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,020`
that I had one time



`261 00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:52,920`
that told me to my face



`262 00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,220`
after I had been using



`263 00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:54,780`
Java Rhino



`264 00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:55,700`
to shell Macs



`265 00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,900`
that Macs can't get shelled



`266 00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:57,980`
and he was in charge



`267 00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:58,620`
of an organization



`268 00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,600`
that



`269 00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,760`
the entire fleet of computers



`270 00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,100`
was like 3,000 Macs



`271 00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,060`
so like the guy



`272 00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:04,800`
in charge of security



`273 00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,080`
didn't believe me



`274 00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,640`
when I told him



`275 00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,500`
you can shell a Mac



`276 00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,560`
and I'm like well



`277 00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,160`
we're probably in bad shape



`278 00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:10,620`
at this point



`279 00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,720`
like if the guy in charge



`280 00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,880`
doesn't believe



`281 00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,980`
the people he hires



`282 00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,720`
to give him



`283 00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,060`
security



`284 00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:16,820`
or actually believes



`285 00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,960`
that an OS is magic



`286 00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,460`
yeah



`287 00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,440`
so I mean



`288 00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,920`
and again



`289 00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,780`
this is one of these like



`290 00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,100`
hang out in leadership



`291 00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,380`
smoke and mirrors



`292 00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,200`
you know



`293 00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,260`
silver tongue



`294 00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,280`
I can do executive speak



`295 00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,020`
I can do corporate stuff



`296 00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,640`
the leadership is placated



`297 00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,960`
and there's lots of platitudes



`298 00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,920`
and happiness there



`299 00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,080`
and as long as those people



`300 00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:36,500`
are happy



`301 00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,500`
like it doesn't matter



`302 00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,460`
what's on fire



`303 00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,080`
on the back end



`304 00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,820`
and that's again



`305 00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,120`
it's like that



`306 00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,560`
all over the place



`307 00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,580`
so it is very



`308 00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,500`
refreshing to see



`309 00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,540`
like in the case



`310 00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,220`
of Ashley Madison



`311 00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,900`
where a competent person



`312 00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:47,420`
stepped in



`313 00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,580`
a person with technical background



`314 00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,660`
that is known by the community



`315 00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,340`
stepped in and said



`316 00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,100`
oh look



`317 00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:51,620`
a problem



`318 00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,460`
and fixed it



`319 00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,920`
to which I applaud



`320 00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,660`
I'm like that's amazing



`321 00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,140`
I'm sure that this stuff



`322 00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,200`
happens behind the scenes



`323 00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,900`
but this is the first occurrence



`324 00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,040`
that I have ever seen



`325 00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:00,900`
of that happening



`326 00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:01,860`
in the public view



`327 00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,100`
where like some company



`328 00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,720`
got completely railroaded



`329 00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,460`
and then



`330 00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,760`
six months later



`331 00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,780`
they were a fortress



`332 00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:10,300`
and all I can do



`333 00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:10,720`
is applaud



`334 00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,640`
that must be work



`335 00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,220`
yeah



`336 00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,820`
cool



`337 00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,360`
I think we should wrap it up there



`338 00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:15,700`
yeah



`339 00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,460`
sounds good



`340 00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,840`
Dan thank you so much



`341 00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,740`
for speaking with us



`342 00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,480`
thank you for having me



`343 00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,260`
it was a great talk



`344 00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,660`
we have one thing



`345 00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,620`
that we actually forgot



`346 00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,080`
we have shameless plug time



`347 00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,500`
oh



`348 00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,340`
where can we read



`349 00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,360`
or find more information



`350 00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,120`
or is it something



`351 00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,920`
you would like to plug



`352 00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,380`
sure



`353 00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,940`
so I run



`354 00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:30,960`
a small security company



`355 00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,320`
called Phobos Group



`356 00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,200`
the domain is



`357 00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,540`
phobos.io



`358 00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,200`
and we do



`359 00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,640`
as I described on stage



`360 00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,800`
we will be Russia at you



`361 00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,940`
and we will be China at you



`362 00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,000`
for the purposes of simulation



`363 00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,200`
but we also



`364 00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,160`
do a lot of remediation



`365 00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:43,840`
and follow on work



`366 00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,880`
not a lot of shops



`367 00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,800`
that do what we do



`368 00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,120`
do the follow on work



`369 00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:48,760`
they'll come in



`370 00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,440`
and they'll do an assessment



`371 00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:49,820`
for you



`372 00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,600`
and they hand you a report



`373 00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,220`
and they walk away



`374 00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,740`
we'll hand you a report



`375 00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,360`
and say we're willing



`376 00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,060`
to bid on this work



`377 00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,120`
if you're willing to have us



`378 00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,340`
and we have



`379 00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,700`
so far a really good track record



`380 00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,500`
for nailing down



`381 00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,240`
everything we find



`382 00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,580`
and our long term customers



`383 00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,420`
year over year



`384 00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,980`
become fairly hardened



`385 00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:03,980`
we end up being



`386 00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:04,900`
their incident response people



`387 00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:05,200`
as well



`388 00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,460`
so we



`389 00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,840`
we stepped off



`390 00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,180`
the path of compliance



`391 00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,040`
in its entirety



`392 00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:10,940`
because our relief



`393 00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:11,300`
is that



`394 00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,180`
while compliance



`395 00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,140`
is legally required



`396 00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,540`
it should not be a model



`397 00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,060`
for anything



`398 00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,160`
except for just making



`399 00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:16,920`
the auditors happy



`400 00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,560`
so leave it that



`401 00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,360`
like compliance



`402 00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:19,800`
and security



`403 00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,680`
are two different things



`404 00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,320`
they should be treated



`405 00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,240`
as two different things



`406 00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,520`
like you should not



`407 00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,060`
model your security practice



`408 00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,420`
on what the compliance



`409 00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,680`
people say it should be



`410 00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,460`
you should



`411 00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,400`
look at your own



`412 00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:29,740`
equipment



`413 00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,240`
and make it feel safe



`414 00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,360`
and make it do what you want



`415 00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,080`
and then



`416 00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,300`
look and see



`417 00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,140`
is it compliant



`418 00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,820`
because 90% of the time



`419 00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,500`
it will be



`420 00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,940`
whatever you do



`421 00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,000`
if you're



`422 00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,920`
technical enough



`423 00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,540`
and your abilities



`424 00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,620`
will be



`425 00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,740`
far and above



`426 00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,880`
beyond what the



`427 00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,620`
compliance regulatory



`428 00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,100`
stuff asks for



`429 00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,520`
so when the auditors



`430 00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:48,960`
come around



`431 00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,780`
like you don't have to do



`432 00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,360`
extra work



`433 00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,000`
to be compliant



`434 00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,100`
you're already compliant



`435 00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:52,560`
because you did



`436 00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,480`
good security work



`437 00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,580`
and that's our



`438 00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,440`
sort of mantra is



`439 00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,540`
we're going to do everything



`440 00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,180`
from the perspective



`441 00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:57,820`
of the attacker



`442 00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,760`
so we're going to look



`443 00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,220`
at your perimeter



`444 00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:00,640`
we're going to look



`445 00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,120`
at your land



`446 00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,820`
we're going to look



`447 00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:02,640`
at postures



`448 00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:02,980`
we're going to look



`449 00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:03,340`
at people



`450 00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,020`
we're going to do



`451 00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:04,680`
social engineering



`452 00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,200`
all that sort of stuff



`453 00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:05,900`
from the perspective



`454 00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:06,460`
of an attacker



`455 00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,760`
not from the perspective



`456 00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,060`
of we're going to make sure



`457 00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,260`
that you check all the boxes



`458 00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:10,840`
we're going to say



`459 00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,540`
like can people



`460 00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,680`
come in and steal from you



`461 00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,640`
can people implant malware



`462 00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,160`
can people do terrible things



`463 00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,400`
because if you solve



`464 00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,560`
all those real world problems



`465 00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,720`
then everything else



`466 00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,120`
is just



`467 00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,260`
it's a cascading win



`468 00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:22,780`
everything else



`469 00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,760`
just falls in line



`470 00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,800`
that's the stuff



`471 00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,600`
you want to avoid anyway



`472 00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,600`
exactly yeah



`473 00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,320`
so the idea is



`474 00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:27,980`
if you do it once



`475 00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:28,620`
and you do it right



`476 00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,300`
you're going to have



`477 00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:29,980`
a much better time



`478 00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,120`
you'll sleep better at night



`479 00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:31,420`
great



`480 00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,420`
cool



`481 00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:32,900`
fantastic



`482 00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,660`
thank you so much



`483 00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,200`
thanks again



`484 00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,640`
hi and welcome



`485 00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,020`
to Säkerhetspodcasten



`486 00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,000`
live-ish



`487 00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,120`
on Säkti



`488 00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,520`
we are sitting here



`489 00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,980`
with Olle



`490 00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,460`
and Pasi



`491 00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,240`
who has just come off stage



`492 00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,360`
talked about



`493 00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,660`
cold boot attacks



`494 00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,760`
so



`495 00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,900`
tell me more



`496 00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,280`
well



`497 00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,260`
yeah so



`498 00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,260`
cold boot attacks



`499 00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,420`
are a class of attacks



`500 00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,260`
that were discovered



`501 00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,280`
well



`502 00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,180`
pretty much



`503 00:13:59,180 --> 00:13:59,860`
10 years ago



`504 00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:00,820`
in 2008



`505 00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,360`
and so people know



`506 00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,360`
about the class of attacks



`507 00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:03,880`
but



`508 00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,240`
not many people



`509 00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,040`
have actually tried



`510 00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:06,580`
to use it



`511 00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,900`
in a real world scenario



`512 00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,580`
so



`513 00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,460`
that's kind of



`514 00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,020`
what we've done



`515 00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:10,880`
and we've figured out



`516 00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,240`
also



`517 00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:11,500`
ways



`518 00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,200`
that we can



`519 00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:12,240`
kind of



`520 00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,560`
defeating all of the



`521 00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,040`
different



`522 00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,360`
mitigations



`523 00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:15,780`
that have been



`524 00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,340`
put in place



`525 00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,220`
during these 10 years



`526 00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,120`
to prevent



`527 00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,380`
this type of attack



`528 00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,100`
in short



`529 00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,300`
what is a cold boot attack?



`530 00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,900`
so it's about



`531 00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,240`
stealing secrets



`532 00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,000`
out of the memory



`533 00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,640`
of a computer



`534 00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,480`
by rebooting it



`535 00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,820`
and



`536 00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,160`
booting into



`537 00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,100`
your own OS



`538 00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:31,680`
or your own



`539 00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,240`
software



`540 00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,720`
that's basically



`541 00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,340`
what it is



`542 00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:34,640`
so



`543 00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,020`
it's because



`544 00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:36,920`
RAM chips



`545 00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,660`
when you reboot



`546 00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,100`
a machine



`547 00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,060`
they don't lose



`548 00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:39,660`
the contents



`549 00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,720`
they actually



`550 00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,240`
stick around



`551 00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:41,800`
for a while



`552 00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,860`
after the



`553 00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:43,780`
power is cut



`554 00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:44,800`
so



`555 00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,920`
because of that



`556 00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,220`
you actually have



`557 00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,120`
the contents



`558 00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,040`
of the last boot



`559 00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,780`
in memory



`560 00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,960`
when you do a reboot



`561 00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,040`
that was actually



`562 00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,040`
the thing that surprised me



`563 00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:53,400`
the most



`564 00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,580`
you were actually



`565 00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,180`
doing this



`566 00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,380`
live on stage



`567 00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:56,820`
of course



`568 00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,560`
with the spray can



`569 00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:58,920`
and all



`570 00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,720`
and I was



`571 00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,600`
surprised at



`572 00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,000`
the calmness



`573 00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,880`
you didn't really



`574 00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,860`
have to stress it



`575 00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:04,300`
that much



`576 00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,100`
you could take



`577 00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:05,720`
your time



`578 00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,400`
and you sprayed



`579 00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:06,700`
some



`580 00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,440`
not that much



`581 00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,020`
you just sprayed



`582 00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:08,540`
a couple of times



`583 00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,600`
and that



`584 00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,120`
the



`585 00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:10,960`
memory



`586 00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,760`
contents



`587 00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,260`
were there



`588 00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,380`
for such a long time



`589 00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,540`
that really surprised me



`590 00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,000`
yes



`591 00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,940`
so the key is



`592 00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:16,440`
the



`593 00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,960`
free spray



`594 00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,100`
to lower



`595 00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:19,700`
the



`596 00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,120`
temperature



`597 00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,140`
of the RAM chips



`598 00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:22,720`
because then



`599 00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,520`
the contents



`600 00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,060`
stick around



`601 00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:24,560`
for longer



`602 00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,700`
so how long



`603 00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,400`
would it stick around



`604 00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,160`
if you don't use



`605 00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:27,620`
a free spray



`606 00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,140`
approximately



`607 00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:29,900`
we had issues



`608 00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,720`
just rebooting



`609 00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,340`
like at room temperature



`610 00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,060`
it depends



`611 00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,820`
like 10-20 seconds



`612 00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,340`
or something



`613 00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,220`
no no no



`614 00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:36,720`
not even that



`615 00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,740`
like some seconds



`616 00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,740`
but only two sprays



`617 00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,820`
with spray cans



`618 00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,660`
and you get



`619 00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,380`
up to a minute



`620 00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,300`
well



`621 00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,360`
we haven't had



`622 00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,340`
one minute perhaps



`623 00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,280`
but yeah



`624 00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,320`
there are



`625 00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,120`
academic papers



`626 00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,100`
about



`627 00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,260`
exactly this problem



`628 00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,420`
how long does it



`629 00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:52,860`
stick around



`630 00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,560`
and how much



`631 00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,080`
do you have to



`632 00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:54,520`
freeze it



`633 00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,020`
and all that



`634 00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:55,300`
stuff



`635 00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,540`
and they have



`636 00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,420`
seen in some



`637 00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:57,820`
cases



`638 00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:58,320`
some memory



`639 00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:58,820`
technology



`640 00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,400`
when taken



`641 00:15:59,400 --> 00:15:59,820`
to a low



`642 00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,200`
temperature



`643 00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,640`
actually remain



`644 00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,640`
for up to a minute



`645 00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,400`
but you know



`646 00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,960`
you don't need



`647 00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,240`
a minute



`648 00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:05,700`
to perform



`649 00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,080`
the attack



`650 00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:06,440`
basically



`651 00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,260`
all you need



`652 00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:07,860`
you need to



`653 00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:08,640`
know it



`654 00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:08,980`
so you



`655 00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:09,800`
perform it



`656 00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,340`
correctly



`657 00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:10,920`
and



`658 00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,100`
keep the pace



`659 00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:12,880`
if you prepare



`660 00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,380`
the attack



`661 00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:13,640`
yeah



`662 00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,200`
you don't need



`663 00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:14,560`
a minute



`664 00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,660`
so what was



`665 00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:15,880`
it like



`666 00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,540`
30 seconds



`667 00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,080`
for your attack



`668 00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,540`
from restart



`669 00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,740`
I'd say



`670 00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,380`
less



`671 00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,280`
the only



`672 00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:22,820`
time



`673 00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,420`
essential



`674 00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:23,980`
thing



`675 00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:24,600`
is after



`676 00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,120`
you plug



`677 00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:25,480`
out the



`678 00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:25,800`
power



`679 00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,680`
and plug



`680 00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,100`
it in



`681 00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:27,480`
so



`682 00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,520`
in our



`683 00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,280`
demo



`684 00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:29,760`
I think



`685 00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,500`
we did it



`686 00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,460`
in 5 seconds



`687 00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:31,940`
or less



`688 00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:32,820`
we could



`689 00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,380`
probably



`690 00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,100`
have tripled



`691 00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,000`
that time



`692 00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,580`
without any



`693 00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:35,960`
issues



`694 00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,020`
but



`695 00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,460`
you still



`696 00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:38,860`
have the



`697 00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:39,420`
time to



`698 00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:39,880`
open the



`699 00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,120`
case



`700 00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:40,360`
and you



`701 00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:40,720`
can look



`702 00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,120`
at it



`703 00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,160`
and plan



`704 00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:42,680`
and prepare



`705 00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,160`
so as soon



`706 00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,740`
as power



`707 00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,460`
the chips



`708 00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:45,620`
has



`709 00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:45,960`
power



`710 00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,420`
it starts



`711 00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:46,860`
refreshing



`712 00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,340`
and the



`713 00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:48,600`
decay



`714 00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,020`
stops



`715 00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:49,300`
well



`716 00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:49,840`
at least



`717 00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,280`
when you



`718 00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:50,500`
press



`719 00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:50,800`
the power



`720 00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,040`
button



`721 00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:51,400`
to start



`722 00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:51,720`
booting



`723 00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,060`
it does



`724 00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,200`
so that's



`725 00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:53,900`
the time



`726 00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,360`
that's



`727 00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:54,960`
critical



`728 00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,740`
is from



`729 00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,160`
you



`730 00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,360`
power



`731 00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:57,600`
down



`732 00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:57,760`
the



`733 00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,040`
machine



`734 00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:58,920`
until



`735 00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,700`
it is



`736 00:16:59,700 --> 00:16:59,960`
alive



`737 00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,320`
again



`738 00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,100`
because



`739 00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,320`
that's



`740 00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:02,520`
when



`741 00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,400`
the RAM



`742 00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:03,560`
chips



`743 00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:03,880`
are not



`744 00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,260`
powered



`745 00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:04,760`
so they



`746 00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,060`
need to



`747 00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:05,600`
just keep



`748 00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:05,760`
their



`749 00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,240`
contents



`750 00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:06,560`
by



`751 00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:06,920`
themselves



`752 00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,880`
like



`753 00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,800`
Pasi



`754 00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,140`
said



`755 00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,380`
we don't



`756 00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:10,540`
need



`757 00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:10,660`
to



`758 00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:10,920`
rush



`759 00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,000`
a couple



`760 00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,140`
of



`761 00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:12,460`
seconds



`762 00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:12,700`
is



`763 00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:12,960`
more



`764 00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,120`
than



`765 00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:13,360`
enough



`766 00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:13,480`
to



`767 00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:13,740`
perform



`768 00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:13,900`
it



`769 00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,800`
and



`770 00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:14,980`
you



`771 00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:15,280`
had



`772 00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:15,920`
found



`773 00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,400`
the



`774 00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,040`
specification



`775 00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:17,400`
of



`776 00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:17,540`
the



`777 00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:17,880`
more



`778 00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,280`
bit



`779 00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:18,740`
which



`780 00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,900`
I'm



`781 00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,200`
fairly



`782 00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:20,440`
sure



`783 00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:20,900`
not



`784 00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,160`
many



`785 00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:21,760`
people



`786 00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,740`
had



`787 00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:23,040`
heard



`788 00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:23,320`
about



`789 00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:23,740`
before



`790 00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,100`
that's



`791 00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:24,380`
true



`792 00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:24,580`
I



`793 00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:24,860`
think



`794 00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,460`
it's



`795 00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:26,900`
better



`796 00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:27,400`
documented



`797 00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:27,700`
now



`798 00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,020`
because



`799 00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:28,300`
after

can't



`1234 00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:34,440`
really



`1235 00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:34,880`
measure



`1236 00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:34,900`
the

`1238 00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:35,800`
exactly



`1239 00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,140`
yeah



`1240 00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:36,580`
so



`1241 00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:36,900`
some



`1242 00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:37,620`

`1243 00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,260`
are



`1244 00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:38,640`
hard



`1245 00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:38,980`
to



`1246 00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:39,300`

because



`1251 00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:40,740`
they're



`1252 00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,040`
supposed



`1253 00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:41,160`
to



`1254 00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:41,440`
change



`1255 00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,000`

this



`1257 00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:42,320`
is



`1258 00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:42,640`
exactly



`1259 00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:42,880`
one



`1260 00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,000`

`1261 00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,160`
those

settings



`1263 00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:43,720`
and



`1264 00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,040`
morbid



`1265 00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:44,180`
is



`1266 00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:44,440`
supposed



`1267 00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:44,620`

and



`1270 00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:45,660`
so



`1271 00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:45,780`
you



`1272 00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,000`
can't



`1273 00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,220`
really



`1274 00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:46,860`
include



`1275 00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:47,040`
it



`1276 00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:47,240`
in



`1277 00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:47,560`
any



`1278 00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:47,900`
of



`1279 00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:48,160`
these

`1282 00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:49,460`
yeah



`1283 00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:49,820`
that



`1284 00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:50,080`
was



`1285 00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,340`
my



`1286 00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:50,840`
question



`1287 00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,060`
and



`1288 00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:51,840`
I



`1289 00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,160`
thought



`1290 00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:52,540`
exactly



`1291 00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:52,760`
like



`1292 00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,020`
that



`1293 00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:53,720`
this



`1294 00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,660`
ought



`1295 00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:54,760`
to



`1296 00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:54,880`
be

protected



`1298 00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:55,680`
but



`1299 00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:55,880`
then



`1300 00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,020`
it



`1301 00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:56,160`
will



`1302 00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:56,620`
break



`1303 00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,880`
everything



`1304 00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,400`
exactly



`1305 00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:58,700`
so



`1306 00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,200`
that's



`1307 00:20:59,200 --> 00:20:59,540`
what



`1308 00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,400`
Mattias

`1322 00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:03,580`
like



`1323 00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:03,920`
you



`1324 00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,220`
don't



`1325 00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:04,440`

it



`1337 00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:07,840`
possible

`1345 00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:09,880`
so



`1346 00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,020`
you



`1347 00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:10,240`
don't

that's

don't



`1373 00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:17,480`

`1381 00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:31,920`
basically



`1382 00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,420`
we



`1383 00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,040`
unplug

`1387 00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,140`
then



`1388 00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:35,460`
we



`1389 00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,020`

then



`1395 00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:37,540`
we



`1396 00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,000`
actually



`1397 00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,520`
program



`1398 00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,040`
like



`1399 00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:39,220`
we



`1400 00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:39,540`

and



`1406 00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,740`
then



`1407 00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:42,880`
you



`1408 00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,080`
power



`1409 00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:43,300`

`1415 00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,280`
actually



`1416 00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:46,580`
we



`1417 00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:46,860`
were



`1418 00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:47,220`
able



`1419 00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:47,480`

it



`1425 00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:49,200`

booted



`1427 00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,420`
so



`1428 00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:50,700`
we



`1429 00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,040`
had

`1433 00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,360`
all



`1434 00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:52,700`
to



`1435 00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,060`
modify



`1436 00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:53,140`
lots



`1437 00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:53,320`

`1439 00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,180`
yeah



`1440 00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:54,940`
okay



`1441 00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:55,180`
so



`1442 00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:55,340`
that



`1443 00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:55,560`

we

`1661 00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:11,240`
basically



`1662 00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:11,540`
when



`1663 00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,440`
developing



`1664 00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:12,660`
this



`1665 00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:12,940`
attack



`1666 00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:13,240`
was



`1667 00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:13,820`
we



`1668 00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:14,100`
just



`1669 00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:14,820`
rebooted



`1670 00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:15,080`
until



`1671 00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:15,240`
it



`1672 00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:15,520`
worked



`1673 00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,320`
so



`1674 00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:16,920`
yeah



`1675 00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,740`
if



`1676 00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,980`
you



`1677 00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:21,280`
wouldn't



`1678 00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:21,560`
have



`1679 00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:21,840`
the



`1680 00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,040`

`1681 00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:22,300`

`1682 00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,420`
then



`1683 00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,280`
there



`1684 00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:26,440`
would



`1685 00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:26,880`
also



`1686 00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,020`
be



`1687 00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:27,300`

`1689 00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,080`
attacks



`1690 00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:28,280`
right



`1691 00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:28,440`
you



`1692 00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:28,800`
could



`1693 00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,480`
monitor



`1694 00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,100`

`1697 00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,600`
there



`1698 00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,060`
are



`1699 00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:33,360`
several



`1700 00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:33,740`
different



`1701 00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:34,060`
ways



`1702 00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:34,200`
of



`1703 00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:34,440`
getting



`1704 00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:34,900`
at



`1705 00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:35,300`

`1708 00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,740`
but



`1709 00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,500`
this



`1710 00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,400`
seemed



`1711 00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:38,620`
like



`1712 00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:38,760`
the

easiest



`1714 00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,340`
so



`1715 00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:40,600`
that's



`1716 00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:40,740`
why



`1717 00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:40,920`
we



`1718 00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,120`
chose



`1719 00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:41,300`
it



`1720 00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:41,800`

`1721 00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:41,960`
it



`1722 00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,400`
works



`1723 00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,280`
even



`1724 00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:43,680`

`1729 00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:46,240`
very



`1730 00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:46,740`
reliably



`1731 00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,360`

you



`1733 00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:47,660`

I



`2099 00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:06,420`
think



`2100 00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:06,640`
that's



`2101 00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:06,740`
what



`2102 00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,000`
happened



`2103 00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,140`
in



`2104 00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:07,300`
this



`2105 00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:07,560`
case



`2106 00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:07,800`
is



`2107 00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,020`
that



`2108 00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:08,720`
nobody



`2109 00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:08,940`
had



`2110 00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:09,180`
actually



`2111 00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:09,420`
put



`2112 00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:09,720`
together



`2113 00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:09,900`
the

`2116 00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:10,840`
scenario



`2117 00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,660`
and



`2118 00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:11,980`
figured



`2119 00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:12,240`
out



`2120 00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:12,460`
that



`2121 00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:12,740`
okay



`2122 00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,560`
this



`2123 00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:13,740`

`2124 00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:13,860`

bypassable



`2126 00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:14,780`

`2127 00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:15,120`
this



`2128 00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:15,380`

`2132 00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:16,440`
therefore



`2133 00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:16,720`
we



`2134 00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:16,860`

`2144 00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:18,960`

you



`2146 00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:19,220`
did



`2147 00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:19,380`

`2151 00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:20,760`
didn't



`2152 00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,040`

come



`2158 00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,180`
because



`2159 00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:25,400`
they



`2160 00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:25,600`

`2165 00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,240`
guessed



`2166 00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:28,380`
it

yourself



`2168 00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:29,400`
so



`2169 00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:29,720`
that's



`2170 00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,000`
same

the

a

I



`2404 00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:56,940`
mean



`2405 00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:57,340`
when

no



`2423 00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:08,760`

we



`2428 00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:11,780`
got



`2429 00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:12,200`
this



`2430 00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:12,860`
exception



`2431 00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:13,200`
thing



`2432 00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:13,500`
here



`2433 00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,040`
which



`2434 00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:14,340`
which



`2435 00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:14,840`

`2436 00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,280`
don't



`2437 00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:15,420`
do



`2438 00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:15,600`
it



`2439 00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,060`
sometimes



`2440 00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,420`
yeah



`2441 00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,040`
because



`2442 00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:18,680`
before



`2443 00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,100`

`2446 00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:21,360`
don't



`2447 00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:21,620`
think



`2448 00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:21,920`
many



`2449 00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,520`
people



`2450 00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:22,960`
would



`2451 00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,680`
believe



`2452 00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,960`
would



`2453 00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,440`
guess



`2454 00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:25,860`
that



`2455 00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:26,580`
this

`2457 00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:27,960`
existed



`2458 00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,680`
and it



`2459 00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,040`
worked



`2460 00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:29,360`
the way



`2461 00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:29,520`
it



`2462 00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:29,980`
worked



`2463 00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:30,700`
it's



`2464 00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,220`
definitely



`2465 00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:31,740`
easier



`2466 00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:31,960`
now



`2467 00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,120`
that



`2468 00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:32,420`
Microsoft



`2469 00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,060`

to



`2474 00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:34,740`
find



`2475 00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:34,960`
this



`2476 00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,420`
information



`2477 00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:35,760`
about



`2478 00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:35,960`
how



`2479 00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,140`
this



`2480 00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:36,320`
stuff



`2481 00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:36,720`
works



`2482 00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,240`
and



`2483 00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:37,420`
what



`2484 00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:37,760`
attacks



`2485 00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,060`
are



`2486 00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:38,560`
possible



`2487 00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,460`
so



`2488 00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,440`
that's



`2489 00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:40,560`
but



`2490 00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:40,900`
anyone



`2491 00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:41,180`
could



`2492 00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:41,360`
have



`2493 00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:41,560`
read



`2494 00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:41,840`
this



`2495 00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,220`
document



`2496 00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:42,600`
and



`2497 00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:42,940`
understood



`2498 00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:43,160`
it



`2499 00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:43,880`
reasonably



`2500 00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,920`
but



`2501 00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,540`
we're



`2502 00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:45,800`
not



`2503 00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,380`
very



`2504 00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:46,840`
clever



`2505 00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,880`
so



`2506 00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,260`
I mean



`2507 00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:48,600`
anybody



`2508 00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:48,840`
who



`2509 00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,080`
read



`2510 00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:49,220`

`2512 00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,120`
and



`2513 00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:50,400`
was



`2514 00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:50,720`
thinking



`2515 00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,220`
about



`2516 00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:51,460`
doing



`2517 00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:51,640`
this



`2518 00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:51,920`
attack



`2519 00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,140`
would



`2520 00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:52,260`
have



`2521 00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:52,460`
came



`2522 00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:52,580`
to



`2523 00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:52,720`
the



`2524 00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:52,880`
same



`2525 00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,280`
conclusion



`2526 00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,840`
I'm



`2527 00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,040`
sure



`2528 00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:55,200`
you're



`2529 00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:55,420`
clever



`2530 00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:57,320`
but



`2531 00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:57,740`
you



`2532 00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:57,980`
don't



`2533 00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:58,260`
need



`2534 00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:58,380`
to



`2535 00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:58,520`
be



`2536 00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:58,880`
clever



`2537 00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,460`
in



`2538 00:28:59,460 --> 00:28:59,640`
order



`2539 00:28:59,640 --> 00:28:59,940`
to



`2540 00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:00,400`
figure



`2541 00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:00,560`
it



`2542 00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:00,740`
out



`2543 00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,140`
so



`2544 00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:01,360`
I'm



`2545 00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:01,580`
sure



`2546 00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:01,880`
also



`2547 00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,200`
this



`2548 00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:02,460`
was



`2549 00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:02,600`
a



`2550 00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:02,860`
question



`2551 00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:03,040`
that



`2552 00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,140`
we



`2553 00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:03,320`
didn't



`2554 00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:03,460`
get



`2555 00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:03,660`
asked



`2556 00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:03,800`
on



`2557 00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,100`
stage



`2558 00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:04,380`
but



`2559 00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,420`
I've



`2560 00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:05,700`
been



`2561 00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:05,880`
asked



`2562 00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,280`
before



`2563 00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,080`
I'm



`2564 00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:07,280`
sure



`2565 00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:07,480`
that



`2566 00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:07,720`
other



`2567 00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,000`
people



`2568 00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,180`
have



`2569 00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:08,360`
thought



`2570 00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:08,560`
about



`2571 00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,520`
this



`2572 00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:14,800`
attack



`2573 00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,920`
let's



`2574 00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,080`
say



`2575 00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:16,220`
you



`2576 00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:16,640`
100



`2577 00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,220`
people



`2578 00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:17,620`
which



`2579 00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:17,900`
are



`2580 00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:18,420`
employed



`2581 00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:18,920`
your



`2582 00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,260`
operation



`2583 00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:20,680`
is



`2584 00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,200`
get



`2585 00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:22,480`
other



`2586 00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:22,920`
governments



`2587 00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,460`
computers



`2588 00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:23,980`
and



`2589 00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:24,640`
get



`2590 00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:24,900`
into



`2591 00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:25,160`
them



`2592 00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:25,880`
it's



`2593 00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,340`
reasonable



`2594 00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:26,680`
you



`2595 00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,240`
should



`2596 00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,600`
investigate



`2597 00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,200`
if



`2598 00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:29,360`
your



`2599 00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:29,800`
business



`2600 00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,320`
is



`2601 00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,240`
stealing



`2602 00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:31,740`
or



`2603 00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,300`
unlocking



`2604 00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:32,540`
other



`2605 00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:32,900`
people's



`2606 00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:33,260`
computers



`2607 00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:33,740`
might



`2608 00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:34,600`
be



`2609 00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:34,760`
law



`2610 00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,180`
enforcement



`2611 00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:35,400`
for



`2612 00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:35,740`
example



`2613 00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,040`
you



`2614 00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:36,260`
might



`2615 00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:36,480`
want



`2616 00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:36,600`
to



`2617 00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:36,920`
unlock



`2618 00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,460`
criminals



`2619 00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:37,840`
computer



`2620 00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,000`
to



`2621 00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,120`
get



`2622 00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:38,480`
evidence



`2623 00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:38,780`
against



`2624 00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:38,940`
them



`2625 00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:39,580`
so



`2626 00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:39,900`
yeah



`2627 00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,540`
definitely



`2628 00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:40,820`
there



`2629 00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:41,280`
probably



`2630 00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:41,540`
are



`2631 00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:41,920`
people



`2632 00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,380`
somewhere



`2633 00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:42,600`
on



`2634 00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:42,740`
this



`2635 00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:42,960`
planet



`2636 00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,140`
that



`2637 00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:43,280`
have



`2638 00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:43,460`
thought



`2639 00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:43,640`
about



`2640 00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:43,840`
this



`2641 00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,160`
before



`2642 00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,660`
that's



`2643 00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:45,980`
part of



`2644 00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:46,080`
the



`2645 00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:46,280`
reason



`2646 00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:46,500`
why



`2647 00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:46,660`
we



`2648 00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:46,900`
want



`2649 00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:47,320`
to



`2650 00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,260`
go



`2651 00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:48,580`
public



`2652 00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:48,740`
with



`2653 00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:48,900`
this



`2654 00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:49,360`
information



`2655 00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:49,620`
and



`2656 00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:49,780`
tell



`2657 00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,180`
everybody



`2658 00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:50,540`
about



`2659 00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:50,680`
it



`2660 00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:50,800`
at



`2661 00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:50,940`
the



`2662 00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:51,100`
same



`2663 00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:51,420`
time



`2664 00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,040`
because



`2665 00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,520`
we



`2666 00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:52,820`
think



`2667 00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:53,120`
that



`2668 00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,940`
people



`2669 00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:55,160`
need



`2670 00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:55,260`
to



`2671 00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:55,420`
be



`2672 00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:55,700`
aware



`2673 00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:55,900`
that



`2674 00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:56,080`
this



`2675 00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:56,340`
risk



`2676 00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:56,820`
exists



`2677 00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,980`
it's



`2678 00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:58,520`
quite



`2679 00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:58,800`
funny



`2680 00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,020`
when



`2681 00:29:59,020 --> 00:29:59,160`
you



`2682 00:29:59,160 --> 00:29:59,380`
read



`2683 00:29:59,380 --> 00:29:59,520`
the



`2684 00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,140`
specification



`2685 00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:00,980`
after



`2686 00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:03,260`
doing



`2687 00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:03,580`
this



`2688 00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:04,920`
it's



`2689 00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,200`
very



`2690 00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:05,700`
obvious



`2691 00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:05,980`
that



`2692 00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:06,140`
they



`2693 00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,900`
knew



`2694 00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,160`
that



`2695 00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:08,380`
this



`2696 00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:08,620`
was



`2697 00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:08,940`
a



`2698 00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:09,580`
real



`2699 00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:10,320`
problem



`2700 00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,100`
but



`2701 00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:11,280`
they



`2702 00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:11,620`
didn't



`2703 00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:11,900`
want



`2704 00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,020`
to



`2705 00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:12,320`
specify



`2706 00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:12,700`
that



`2707 00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,180`
but



`2708 00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:13,380`
you



`2709 00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:13,680`
think



`2710 00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,020`
the



`2711 00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,040`

`2729 00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:25,480`
mentioned



`2730 00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:25,660`
but



`2731 00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,080`
it



`2732 00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:26,900`
had



`2733 00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:27,340`
pictures



`2734 00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,880`
it's



`2735 00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,240`
short



`2736 00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,360`
so



`2737 00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:30,540`
it



`2738 00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:30,940`
was



`2739 00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,160`
quite



`2740 00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:31,520`
readable



`2741 00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,880`
there's



`2742 00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,120`
always



`2743 00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:33,480`
part



`2744 00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:33,620`
of



`2745 00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:33,760`
the

specification



`2747 00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:34,940`
there's



`2748 00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:35,320`
a



`2749 00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,400`
command



`2750 00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:36,920`
exists



`2751 00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,140`
and



`2752 00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:37,280`
it



`2753 00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:37,500`
takes



`2754 00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:37,740`
this



`2755 00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,220`
input



`2756 00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,900`
guess



`2757 00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:40,200`
what



`2758 00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:40,400`
it



`2759 00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:40,920`
does



`2760 00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,820`
it's



`2761 00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:42,100`
up to



`2762 00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:42,320`
you



`2763 00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:42,480`
to



`2764 00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,220`
understand



`2765 00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:43,640`
what



`2766 00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:43,660`
all



`2767 00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:43,680`
the



`2768 00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,600`
this



`2769 00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:44,920`
this



`2770 00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,360`
particular



`2771 00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,080`

`2774 00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:46,960`
actually



`2775 00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,260`
quite



`2776 00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:47,860`
easy



`2777 00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:48,060`

we



`2783 00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,100`
didn't

how

that's



`2852 00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:15,480`
also



`2853 00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:15,940`
interesting



`2854 00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:16,140`
to



`2855 00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:16,680`

paper



`2892 00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:28,520`
stated



`2893 00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,080`
hey



`2894 00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:29,300`
we



`2895 00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:29,480`
knew

1974



`2901 00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,800`

`2902 00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,160`
something



`2903 00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,080`
so



`2904 00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,640`
I



`2905 00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:36,940`
mean



`2906 00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:37,340`
this



`2907 00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:37,480`
is



`2908 00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:37,680`
like



`2909 00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,320`
50



`2910 00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:38,500`

`2914 00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,280`
still



`2915 00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,120`
haven't



`2916 00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:41,320`
solved



`2917 00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:41,520`
it



`2918 00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:41,840`
properly



`2919 00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,300`
that's



`2920 00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:42,580`
true



`2921 00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,660`
it's



`2922 00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:43,780`
a



`2923 00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:44,020`

`2927 00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:46,560`
for



`2928 00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:46,740`
this



`2929 00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,180`
isn't



`2930 00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:47,360`
this



`2931 00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:47,660`
like



`2932 00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:47,880`
you



`2933 00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,120`
hide



`2934 00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:48,280`

`2940 00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,060`
then

apple



`2963 00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:57,480`

have



`2972 00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,300`
something

`2988 00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:07,780`
it's



`2989 00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,180`
easier

that's

`3161 00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,020`
that's



`3162 00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:09,160`

`3795 00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:28,880`
it



`3796 00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,200`
survived



`3797 00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:30,680`
so



`3798 00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,140`
we're



`3799 00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:31,360`
still



`3800 00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:31,820`
friends



`3801 00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:32,480`
so



`3802 00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:32,700`
yeah



`3803 00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:32,800`
i



`3804 00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,180`
guess



`3805 00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:33,380`
it's



`3806 00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:33,680`
nice



`3807 00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,240`
but



`3808 00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,640`
how



`3809 00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:35,860`
did



`3810 00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:36,420`
you



`3811 00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,020`
go



`3812 00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:37,280`
ahead



`3813 00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:37,360`
you



`3814 00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:37,620`
have



`3815 00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:37,860`
found



`3816 00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:38,180`
ways



`3817 00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:38,380`
to



`3818 00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:38,780`
get



`3819 00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:38,920`

down



`3822 00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,400`
is



`3823 00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:40,680`
what's



`3824 00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:40,840`
one



`3825 00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:40,960`

`3828 00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:42,180`
yeah



`3829 00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:42,800`
to



`3830 00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,300`
have



`3831 00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:43,460`
it



`3832 00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:43,820`
yeah



`3833 00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,780`

`3841 00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,020`
how



`3842 00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:50,680`
it



`3843 00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,160`
works



`3844 00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:52,380`
like



`3845 00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:52,700`

`4009 00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:05,960`
is



`4010 00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,220`
not



`4011 00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:06,660`
precise



`4012 00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:07,020`
enough



`4013 00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:07,300`
so



`4014 00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:07,560`
you



`4015 00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:07,700`
have



`4016 00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:07,840`
to



`4017 00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,200`
buy



`4018 00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:08,760`
an



`4019 00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,140`

clock



`4021 00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:10,640`
to



`4022 00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:10,880`
make



`4023 00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,060`
it



`4024 00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:11,420`
work



`4025 00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:11,700`
yeah



`4026 00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:12,320`
and



`4027 00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:12,860`
it's



`4028 00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:13,100`
not



`4029 00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,760`
expensive



`4030 00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,160`
but



`4031 00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:15,400`
you



`4032 00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:15,720`
have



`4033 00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:15,880`
to



`4034 00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,160`
wait



`4035 00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:16,420`
for



`4036 00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:16,600`
the



`4037 00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:16,860`

`4039 00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:17,280`
to



`4040 00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:17,580`
arrive



`4041 00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:17,960`

china



`4043 00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:18,640`
so



`4044 00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,740`
take



`4045 00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:19,960`
a

`4047 00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:20,840`
just



`4048 00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,300`
waiting



`4049 00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:21,560`
for



`4050 00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:21,880`
this



`4051 00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,140`
you



`4052 00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:22,340`
know



`4053 00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:22,920`
small



`4054 00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,180`

`4055 00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:23,400`
that



`4056 00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:23,800`
hardware



`4057 00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,260`
that



`4058 00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:24,380`
you



`4059 00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:24,720`
just



`4060 00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:24,900`
need



`4061 00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:25,020`
to



`4062 00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:25,280`
plug



`4063 00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:25,520`

rf



`4067 00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:26,420`
so



`4068 00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:26,840`
yeah



`4069 00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,020`
and



`4070 00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:27,120`
you



`4071 00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:27,360`
also



`4072 00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:27,620`
did



`4073 00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:27,880`
like



`4074 00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,280`
analysis



`4075 00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:28,540`

since it



`4093 00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,040`

i was



`4097 00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:43,800`
just



`4098 00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,580`
putting

something



`4100 00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:45,400`
in the

`4103 00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:46,260`
snooping



`4104 00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:46,620`

`4106 00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:47,740`

`4107 00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:50,620`
after



`4108 00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:51,300`
that i



`4109 00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:51,460`
got



`4110 00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:51,700`

`4115 00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,300`
i was



`4116 00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:53,520`
able



`4117 00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:53,700`

it



`4123 00:39:58,940 --> 00:39:59,100`
was

fun



`4125 00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,880`

`4225 00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,120`

`4226 00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:43,860`

next

`4250 00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:52,980`
taking



`4251 00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:53,320`

i



`4261 00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:01,380`
think



`4262 00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:01,700`
that's



`4263 00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:01,920`
it



`4264 00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:02,220`
right



`4265 00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:02,580`
yeah



`4266 00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:03,120`
do



`4267 00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:03,220`
you



`4268 00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:03,360`

the

`4606 00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:27,800`
that



`4607 00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:27,900`
we



`4608 00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:28,080`

mess



`4610 00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:28,400`
it



`4611 00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:28,640`
up



`4612 00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,160`

`4613 00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:37,840`
we



`4614 00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:38,040`
really



`4615 00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:38,200`

this



`4619 00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:38,820`
right



`4620 00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:39,500`
otherwise



`4621 00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:39,760`
it



`4622 00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:39,840`
could



`4623 00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:39,920`
be



`4624 00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:40,140`

`4626 00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:40,740`
but



`4627 00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:40,920`
the



`4628 00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:41,100`
thing



`4629 00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:41,300`
is



`4630 00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:41,500`
what



`4631 00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:41,640`
we



`4632 00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:41,840`
have



`4633 00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:42,060`
right



`4634 00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:42,360`
now



`4635 00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:42,640`

so



`4646 00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:47,100`
it's



`4647 00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:47,320`
like



`4648 00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,060`

it

`4671 00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:01,080`
I



`4672 00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:01,360`
guess



`4673 00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:01,700`
but



`4674 00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:02,580`
it



`4675 00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:02,740`
seems



`4676 00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:02,900`
like



`4677 00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:03,020`
we



`4678 00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:03,200`
still



`4679 00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:03,320`
have

go



`4684 00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:04,740`

we



`4686 00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:05,080`
just

there's



`4690 00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:05,800`
a lot

and



`4695 00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,020`
then



`4696 00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,280`
I



`4697 00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:09,500`
think



`4698 00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:10,080`
people



`4699 00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:10,260`

caught



`4701 00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:10,720`
up



`4702 00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:10,880`
in



`4703 00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:11,120`
solving



`4704 00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:11,300`

`4707 00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:12,420`
because



`4708 00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:12,620`
they're



`4709 00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:12,740`
so



`4710 00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:13,140`
difficult



`4711 00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:14,100`
because



`4712 00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:15,280`
they're



`4713 00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,060`
interesting



`4714 00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:16,440`

`4718 00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:17,540`
critical

`4720 00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:18,480`
from

we



`4723 00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:19,100`
are



`4724 00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:19,280`
to

where



`4726 00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:19,500`
we



`4727 00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:19,620`
want



`4728 00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:19,720`
to

and



`4731 00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:20,920`
so



`4732 00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,060`
maybe



`4733 00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:22,300`
just



`4734 00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:22,540`
like



`4735 00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:22,760`
the

`4737 00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:23,200`

`4741 00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:25,900`
the

worry



`4743 00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:26,540`
is



`4744 00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:26,880`
that



`4745 00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:27,120`
we



`4746 00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:27,300`
won't



`4747 00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:27,520`
think



`4748 00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:27,680`

too



`4752 00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:29,100`
late



`4753 00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:29,300`
so



`4754 00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:29,500`
that's



`4755 00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:29,600`
why



`4756 00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:29,720`
we



`4757 00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:29,840`
need



`4758 00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:29,960`
to



`4759 00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:30,220`
think



`4760 00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:30,520`
now



`4761 00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:30,860`
about



`4762 00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:31,820`

that



`4765 00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:32,360`
not

everyone



`4767 00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:32,780`
out

there



`4769 00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:33,140`

happen



`4778 00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:36,180`
so



`4779 00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:36,280`
we



`4780 00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:36,400`
gotta



`4781 00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,000`
think



`4782 00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:37,220`

`4863 00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:12,960`
an

`4865 00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:14,340`
they



`4866 00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:16,780`
drive



`4867 00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:17,120`
instead



`4868 00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:17,260`
and



`4869 00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:17,440`
they're



`4870 00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:17,860`
swapping



`4871 00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:18,380`
the

form



`4874 00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:19,080`

humans



`4878 00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:20,060`
have



`4879 00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:20,200`
ever

done

an

incredibly



`4884 00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:21,940`
dangerous

point



`4886 00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:22,380`
so



`4887 00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:22,580`
I



`4888 00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:22,720`
can



`4889 00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:22,900`
see

aspect



`4892 00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:23,700`
but



`4893 00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:23,860`
then



`4894 00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:24,100`
again



`4895 00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:24,300`
if



`4896 00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:24,480`
you



`4897 00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:24,940`
look



`4898 00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:25,120`
at



`4899 00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:25,600`
where



`4900 00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:25,800`
we



`4901 00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:25,980`
are



`4902 00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:26,260`
today



`4903 00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:26,480`

we're



`4910 00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:29,140`
still

go

`4920 00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:32,120`
actually



`4921 00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:33,120`
manage



`4922 00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:33,360`

like



`4932 00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:37,080`
you



`4933 00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:37,300`
get



`4934 00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:37,780`
a

a



`4939 00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:39,880`
really



`4940 00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:40,500`
dedicated

path



`4942 00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:41,380`
like

airport

`4946 00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:42,880`
something



`4947 00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:43,100`
like



`4948 00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:43,360`
that



`4949 00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:44,140`
fine



`4950 00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:44,620`
but



`4951 00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:44,800`
when



`4952 00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:44,880`
you



`4953 00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:45,040`
come



`4954 00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:45,140`
to



`4955 00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:45,240`
a



`4956 00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:45,560`
complex



`4957 00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:45,960`
environment



`4958 00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:46,200`
where



`4959 00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:46,400`
things



`4960 00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:46,700`
start



`4961 00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:47,180`
moving



`4962 00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:47,680`
and



`4963 00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:48,020`
especially



`4964 00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:48,280`
where



`4965 00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:48,420`
you



`4966 00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:48,720`
have



`4967 00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:49,100`
other



`4968 00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:49,780`
people



`4969 00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:50,200`
driving



`4970 00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:50,520`
cars



`4971 00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:50,700`
as



`4972 00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:50,920`
well



`4973 00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:51,200`
yeah



`4974 00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:51,940`
that



`4975 00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:52,280`
makes



`4976 00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:52,420`
it



`4977 00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:52,660`
even



`4978 00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:53,040`
worse



`4979 00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:53,520`
so



`4980 00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:53,620`
I



`4981 00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:53,740`
would



`4982 00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:53,900`
say



`4983 00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:54,780`
there's



`4984 00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:55,380`
still



`4985 00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:56,260`
a



`4986 00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:56,720`
lot



`4987 00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:56,880`
of



`4988 00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:57,220`
technical



`4989 00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:57,700`
challenges



`4990 00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:58,040`
to be



`4991 00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:58,240`
solved



`4992 00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:58,460`
until



`4993 00:45:58,460 --> 00:45:58,700`
we



`4994 00:45:58,700 --> 00:45:58,940`
can



`4995 00:45:58,940 --> 00:45:59,680`
realize



`4996 00:45:59,680 --> 00:45:59,980`
the



`4997 00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:00,440`
potential



`4998 00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:00,840`
yeah



`4999 00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:01,080`
that's



`5000 00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:01,280`
true



`5001 00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:01,460`
but



`5002 00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:01,760`
let's



`5003 00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:02,300`
remember



`5004 00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:02,480`
we're



`5005 00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:02,600`
not



`5006 00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:02,740`
just



`5007 00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:02,940`
talking



`5008 00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:03,140`
about



`5009 00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:03,520`
cars



`5010 00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:03,800`
and



`5011 00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:03,980`
not



`5012 00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:04,120`
just



`5013 00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:04,300`
talking



`5014 00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:04,760`
about



`5015 00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,640`
aerial



`5016 00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:07,120`

`5017 00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:07,640`

space



`5021 00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:12,140`
is



`5022 00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:13,020`
ripe



`5023 00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:13,480`
for



`5024 00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,420`
autonomous

systems



`5026 00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:15,240`
because



`5027 00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:15,480`
the



`5028 00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:15,740`
sea



`5029 00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:15,960`
is



`5030 00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:16,440`
dangerous



`5031 00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,280`
sea



`5032 00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:18,520`
journeys



`5033 00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:18,720`
take



`5034 00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:18,820`
a

time



`5037 00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:19,400`
it's



`5038 00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:19,880`
boring



`5039 00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,120`
and



`5040 00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,100`
to



`5041 00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:22,400`
put



`5042 00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:22,900`
all



`5043 00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:23,020`

`5047 00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:24,140`

`5053 00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:25,520`
that



`5054 00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:25,700`
has



`5055 00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:25,900`
to



`5056 00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:26,240`

hurricanes



`5059 00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:29,240`
it's



`5060 00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:29,700`
expensive



`5061 00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:31,000`
there's



`5062 00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:31,100`
all

`5065 00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:32,420`

`5066 00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:33,280`

`5149 00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:07,840`
so



`5150 00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:09,360`
good



`5151 00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:10,520`
joke



`5152 00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:11,400`
so



`5153 00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:11,540`
you



`5154 00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:11,660`
know



`5155 00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:11,920`
like



`5156 00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:12,180`
the

`5158 00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:12,940`
there



`5159 00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:13,520`
but



`5160 00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:13,620`
he's



`5161 00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:13,720`
not



`5162 00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:13,840`

anything



`5166 00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:17,400`
so



`5167 00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,220`
I



`5168 00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:19,640`
think



`5169 00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:20,100`
that's



`5170 00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:20,640`
sort

things



`5174 00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:21,320`
will



`5175 00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:21,520`
go



`5176 00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:21,980`
right



`5177 00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:22,320`
now



`5178 00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:22,740`
all



`5179 00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:22,860`

`5183 00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:23,980`

`5186 00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:25,200`
there



`5187 00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:25,620`
and



`5188 00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:26,400`
you



`5189 00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:26,520`
just



`5190 00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:26,620`
have



`5191 00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:26,680`

sure



`5194 00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:27,020`

attention



`5200 00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:28,980`
obviously



`5201 00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:30,160`
uber



`5202 00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:30,500`
had a

`5204 00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:30,980`

it's



`5214 00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:38,620`
going

`5290 00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:02,120`
of



`5291 00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:02,240`
the



`5292 00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:02,580`
flight



`5293 00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:02,900`
hours



`5294 00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:03,260`
are



`5295 00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:03,620`
done



`5296 00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:03,800`
by



`5297 00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:04,340`
autopilot



`5298 00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:04,680`
by



`5299 00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:05,180`
the



`5300 00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:05,600`
safety



`5301 00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:06,000`
pilot



`5302 00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:06,420`
and



`5303 00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:14,900`
yeah



`5304 00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:16,020`
I think



`5305 00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:16,140`
the



`5306 00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:16,520`
uptake



`5307 00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:16,880`
has



`5308 00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:17,040`
been



`5309 00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:17,440`
highest



`5310 00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:17,760`
in



`5311 00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:17,960`
the



`5312 00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:18,260`
aerial



`5313 00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:18,720`
space



`5314 00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:19,160`
because



`5315 00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:19,520`
collision



`5316 00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:19,980`
avoidance



`5317 00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:20,120`
is



`5318 00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:20,280`
less



`5319 00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:20,380`
of



`5320 00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:20,460`
a



`5321 00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:20,720`
problem



`5322 00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:21,940`
and



`5323 00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:24,640`
there's



`5324 00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:24,920`
a lot



`5325 00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:25,040`
of



`5326 00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:25,940`
space



`5327 00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:26,220`
in



`5328 00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:26,340`
the



`5329 00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:26,600`
air



`5330 00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:26,800`
and



`5331 00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:27,340`
everything's



`5332 00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:27,700`
tracked



`5333 00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:28,260`
so



`5334 00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:28,500`
they



`5335 00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:28,660`
just



`5336 00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:28,780`
don't



`5337 00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:28,900`
have



`5338 00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:29,000`
to



`5339 00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:29,240`
worry



`5340 00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:29,540`
about



`5341 00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:29,820`
a



`5342 00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:29,960`
lot



`5343 00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:30,060`
of



`5344 00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:30,260`
those



`5345 00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:30,420`
sort



`5346 00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:30,580`
of



`5347 00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:30,820`
very



`5348 00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:31,200`
basic



`5349 00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:31,560`
things



`5350 00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:31,760`
yeah



`5351 00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:31,920`
and



`5352 00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:32,240`
if



`5353 00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:32,420`
the



`5354 00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:32,820`
GPS



`5355 00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:33,020`
or



`5356 00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:33,400`
positioning



`5357 00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:33,840`
system



`5358 00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:34,040`
is



`5359 00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:34,340`
off



`5360 00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:34,600`
by



`5361 00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:35,000`
10



`5362 00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:35,140`

`5363 00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:35,360`
20



`5364 00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:35,660`
meters



`5365 00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:35,960`
that's



`5366 00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:36,060`
not



`5367 00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:36,160`
a



`5368 00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:36,460`
problem



`5369 00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:36,960`
they



`5370 00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:37,160`
have



`5371 00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:37,580`
larger



`5372 00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:38,180`
margins



`5373 00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:38,380`
of



`5374 00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:39,160`
yeah



`5375 00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:39,400`
here's



`5376 00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:39,480`
a



`5377 00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:39,620`
really



`5378 00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:40,080`
interesting



`5379 00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:40,520`
example



`5380 00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:40,940`
so



`5381 00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:41,780`
the



`5382 00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:42,220`
military



`5383 00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:42,620`
when



`5384 00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:42,920`
they



`5385 00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:43,680`
have



`5386 00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:44,140`
they



`5387 00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:44,260`
have



`5388 00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:44,600`
expensive

aircraft



`5391 00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:45,620`
right



`5392 00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:45,800`
they



`5393 00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:45,980`
cost



`5394 00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:46,260`
millions



`5395 00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:46,580`
dollars



`5396 00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:47,240`
whatever



`5397 00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:47,820`
let's



`5398 00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:47,980`
say



`5399 00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:48,240`
20



`5400 00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:48,440`
30



`5401 00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:48,680`
million



`5402 00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:48,980`
dollars



`5403 00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:49,280`
per



`5404 00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:49,820`
airframe



`5405 00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:51,140`
and



`5406 00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:51,380`
most



`5407 00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:51,540`

`5408 00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:51,680`
them



`5409 00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:51,860`
have



`5410 00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:52,380`
supervisory



`5411 00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:52,740`

`5415 00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:53,460`
somewhere



`5416 00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:53,820`
so



`5417 00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:54,280`
there's



`5418 00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:54,560`
someone



`5419 00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:55,100`
that may



`5420 00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:55,220`
be



`5421 00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:55,440`
giving



`5422 00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:55,580`

`5425 00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:56,500`
so



`5426 00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:56,720`
whatever



`5427 00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:57,060`
but



`5428 00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:57,480`
they're



`5429 00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,340`
monitoring



`5430 00:48:58,340 --> 00:48:58,560`
what



`5431 00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:58,680`
it's



`5432 00:48:58,680 --> 00:48:58,900`
doing



`5433 00:48:58,900 --> 00:48:59,100`

people



`5504 00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:22,280`
so



`5505 00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:22,400`
the

`5508 00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:23,220`
rather



`5509 00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:23,700`
lose



`5510 00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:24,480`

`5514 00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:26,460`
than



`5515 00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:26,780`
put



`5516 00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:34,380`
it

`5526 00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:40,820`
maybe



`5527 00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:41,060`
than



`5528 00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:41,280`
we



`5529 00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:41,500`

`5530 00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:41,660`
see

`5539 00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:44,100`
it



`5540 00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:44,140`

be



`5542 00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:44,300`
really



`5543 00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:44,560`

`5563 00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:52,540`
do



`5564 00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:52,920`
certainly



`5565 00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:53,120`

they're



`5575 00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:55,200`
just



`5576 00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:55,460`

`5717 00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:49,060`
tell



`5718 00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:49,220`
you



`5719 00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:49,340`
when



`5720 00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:49,420`
you



`5721 00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:49,620`
put



`5722 00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:49,700`
it



`5723 00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:49,780`
on



`5724 00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:49,860`
the



`5725 00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:50,100`
truck



`5726 00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:50,300`
I



`5727 00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:50,860`
was



`5728 00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:52,400`
like



`5729 00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:52,640`
I



`5730 00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:53,680`
did



`5731 00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:53,820`
all



`5732 00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:53,920`
the



`5733 00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:54,220`
customs



`5734 00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:54,380`
and



`5735 00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:54,540`
everything



`5736 00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:55,780`
exactly



`5737 00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:56,240`
what



`5738 00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:56,520`
ship



`5739 00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:56,620`
it



`5740 00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:56,740`
was



`5741 00:50:56,740 --> 00:50:56,980`
on



`5742 00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:59,260`
so



`5743 00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:00,560`
you



`5744 00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:00,640`
know



`5745 00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:00,820`
that



`5746 00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:01,120`
you



`5747 00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:01,240`
got



`5748 00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:01,340`
an



`5749 00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:01,620`
advantage



`5750 00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:01,980`
there



`5751 00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:02,420`
but



`5752 00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:02,920`
on



`5753 00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:03,000`
the



`5754 00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:03,120`
other



`5755 00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:03,300`
hand



`5756 00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:03,480`
I



`5757 00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:04,140`
think



`5758 00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:06,720`
maritime



`5759 00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:07,320`
is a



`5760 00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:07,720`
great



`5761 00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:08,180`
space



`5762 00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:09,220`
for



`5763 00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:10,280`
automation



`5764 00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:11,500`
but



`5765 00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:11,620`
if



`5766 00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:11,700`
you



`5767 00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:11,960`
look



`5768 00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:12,100`
at



`5769 00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:12,360`
the



`5770 00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:12,840`
organization



`5771 00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:13,060`
that



`5772 00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:13,240`
does



`5773 00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:13,500`
most



`5774 00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:13,700`
of



`5775 00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:14,080`
the



`5776 00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:15,140`
political



`5777 00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:16,280`
support



`5778 00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:16,920`
for



`5779 00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:17,020`
the



`5780 00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:17,380`
industry



`5781 00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:17,640`
and



`5782 00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:18,200`
it's



`5783 00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:18,360`
not



`5784 00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:18,500`
in



`5785 00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:18,620`
their



`5786 00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:18,840`
top



`5787 00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:19,180`
two



`5788 00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:20,360`
applications



`5789 00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:20,780`
where



`5790 00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:20,920`
they



`5791 00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:21,760`
think



`5792 00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:22,160`
uptake



`5793 00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:22,480`
and



`5794 00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,020`
revenues



`5795 00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:23,420`
are



`5796 00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:23,520`
going



`5797 00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:23,560`
to



`5798 00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:23,640`
be



`5799 00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:23,800`
the



`5800 00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:24,100`
fastest



`5801 00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:24,500`
they



`5802 00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:25,200`
think



`5803 00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:25,840`
precision



`5804 00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:26,360`
agriculture



`5805 00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:27,020`
so



`5806 00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:27,280`
making



`5807 00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:27,700`
farming



`5808 00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:27,940`
more



`5809 00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:28,260`
efficient



`5810 00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:29,920`
and



`5811 00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,100`
driverless



`5812 00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:31,420`
vehicles



`5813 00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:32,460`
and



`5814 00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:32,580`
I



`5815 00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:32,700`
think



`5816 00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:32,940`
that's



`5817 00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:33,100`
just



`5818 00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:33,320`
because



`5819 00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:33,480`
of



`5820 00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:33,620`
the

`5822 00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:34,160`
number



`5823 00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:34,640`

vehicles



`5825 00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:35,120`
you



`5826 00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:35,240`
could



`5827 00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:35,640`
replace



`5828 00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:36,680`
yeah



`5829 00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:37,100`
did



`5830 00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:37,200`
you



`5831 00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:37,360`
look



`5832 00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:37,460`
at



`5833 00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:38,640`
the



`5834 00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,960`

`5835 00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:41,460`

year



`5840 00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:46,420`
they



`5841 00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:47,360`
downplayed



`5842 00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:47,920`
the



`5843 00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,260`

`5844 00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:49,840`
part



`5845 00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:50,380`
pretty



`5846 00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:50,720`
hard



`5847 00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:51,180`
they



`5848 00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:51,400`
thought



`5849 00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:51,700`
that



`5850 00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:52,440`
lidar



`5851 00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:52,700`
is



`5852 00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:53,760`
a



`5853 00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:54,100`
solution



`5854 00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:54,260`
to



`5855 00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:54,660`
anything



`5856 00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:55,360`
because



`5857 00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:55,580`
you



`5858 00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:56,840`
can't



`5859 00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:57,020`
really



`5860 00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:57,260`
fool



`5861 00:51:57,260 --> 00:51:57,480`
any



`5862 00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:57,680`
of



`5863 00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:57,800`
the

sensor



`5865 00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:58,440`
because



`5866 00:51:58,440 --> 00:51:58,580`
the



`5867 00:51:58,580 --> 00:51:59,140`

`5868 00:51:59,140 --> 00:51:59,320`

`5869 00:51:59,320 --> 00:51:59,440`
be



`5870 00:51:59,440 --> 00:51:59,660`
the

`5872 00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:00,780`

`5873 00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:00,920`
if



`5874 00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:01,040`
the

`5876 00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:01,460`
gets



`5877 00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:01,940`
confused



`5878 00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:02,160`
the

car



`5880 00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:02,420`
will



`5881 00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:02,620`
actually



`5882 00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:03,060`
stop



`5883 00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:03,880`
yeah



`5884 00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:04,040`
but



`5885 00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:04,220`
maybe



`5886 00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:04,440`
that's



`5887 00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:04,540`
what



`5888 00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:04,640`
you



`5889 00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:04,940`
want



`5890 00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:05,260`
as



`5891 00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:05,360`
an

attacker



`5893 00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:06,040`
as



`5894 00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:07,800`
I



`5895 00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:08,380`
showed



`5896 00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:08,480`
in



`5897 00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:08,600`
my



`5898 00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:08,840`
talk



`5899 00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:09,100`
it's



`5900 00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:09,480`
very



`5901 00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:11,680`
docible



`5902 00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:12,720`
and



`5903 00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:12,920`
it's



`5904 00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:13,100`
very



`5905 00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:13,560`
spoofable



`5906 00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:13,800`
too



`5907 00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:14,720`
and



`5908 00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:15,100`
then



`5909 00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:16,100`
it



`5910 00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:16,280`
would



`5911 00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:16,440`
be



`5912 00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:16,920`
really



`5913 00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:17,680`
like



`5914 00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:17,900`
the

`5919 00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:19,340`
really



`5920 00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:19,800`
frequently



`5921 00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:20,380`
because



`5922 00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:20,560`
as



`5923 00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:20,660`
you



`5924 00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:20,800`
said



`5925 00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:21,060`
like



`5926 00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:21,700`
overgrowth



`5927 00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:22,040`

something



`5934 00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:24,940`
would



`5935 00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:25,220`
change

that

`5945 00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:28,740`

there's



`5960 00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:33,760`

`5965 00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:35,080`

you

`6060 00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:13,120`
that's



`6061 00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:13,300`
like



`6062 00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:13,860`
maybe



`6063 00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:14,880`

`6071 00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:18,480`
infrequently



`6072 00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:19,580`

`6078 00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:22,540`
it's

so



`6083 00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:24,760`
it's



`6084 00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:25,040`
feasible



`6085 00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:25,240`

`6088 00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:26,160`
then



`6089 00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:26,320`
you



`6090 00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:26,540`
can



`6091 00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:26,780`
just



`6092 00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:27,160`
match



`6093 00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:27,600`
so



`6094 00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:27,840`
you



`6095 00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:28,020`

it's



`6107 00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:32,000`
pretty



`6108 00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:32,320`

then



`6123 00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:40,640`
I



`6124 00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:40,820`
think



`6125 00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:41,060`
as



`6126 00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:41,200`

that's

I'm



`6445 00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:43,020`

and



`6808 00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:01,840`
probably



`6809 00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:02,180`
dealing



`6810 00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:02,360`

a lot



`6812 00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:02,700`

that



`6817 00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:05,300`
trip



`6818 00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:06,200`
that's



`6819 00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:06,320`
going



`6820 00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:06,360`
to

a



`6823 00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:06,860`
huge



`6824 00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:07,180`

`6827 00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:08,120`
is



`6828 00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:08,240`
going



`6829 00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:08,320`
to

specific



`6833 00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:09,820`
I guess



`6834 00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:10,160`
so



`6835 00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:10,420`
each



`6836 00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:10,720`

`6841 00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:13,120`
well



`6842 00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:13,500`
I mean



`6843 00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:13,680`
that



`6844 00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:13,980`
depends



`6845 00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:14,080`
on



`6846 00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:14,180`
how



`6847 00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:14,260`
you



`6848 00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:14,380`
want



`6849 00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:14,480`
to



`6850 00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:14,620`
set



`6851 00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:14,700`
it



`6852 00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:14,840`
up



`6853 00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:15,960`
and



`6854 00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:16,260`
if



`6855 00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:16,400`
you're



`6856 00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:16,560`
talking

`6859 00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:17,360`
as



`6860 00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:17,560`
well



`6861 00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:18,260`
so



`6862 00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:19,840`
how



`6863 00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:20,040`
that's



`6864 00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:20,180`
going



`6865 00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:20,220`
to



`6866 00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:20,400`
work



`6867 00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:20,760`
is



`6868 00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:21,580`
not



`6869 00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:21,720`
going



`6870 00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:21,760`
to



`6871 00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:21,860`
be



`6872 00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:22,080`
easy



`6873 00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:22,260`
but



`6874 00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:22,720`
from



`6875 00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:22,900`
my



`6876 00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:23,300`
perspective



`6877 00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:24,180`
because



`6878 00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:25,420`
in the



`6879 00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:25,580`

`6882 00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:26,560`
one's



`6883 00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:26,720`
really



`6884 00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:27,020`
thinking



`6885 00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:27,440`
about



`6886 00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:28,860`
crossing



`6887 00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:29,360`

`6889 00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:30,080`
on a

car



`6891 00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:30,420`
trip



`6892 00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:30,680`
but



`6893 00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:30,880`
in



`6894 00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:31,100`
Europe



`6895 00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:31,320`
you



`6896 00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:31,460`
have



`6897 00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:31,560`
to



`6898 00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:31,720`
care



`6899 00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:31,880`
about



`6900 00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:32,020`
that



`6901 00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:32,440`
exactly



`6902 00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:32,960`
completely



`6903 00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:33,580`
different

`6906 00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:35,680`
lots



`6907 00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:36,540`
yeah



`6908 00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:38,120`
well



`6909 00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:38,260`
it's



`6910 00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:38,340`
going



`6911 00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:38,380`
to



`6912 00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:38,500`
