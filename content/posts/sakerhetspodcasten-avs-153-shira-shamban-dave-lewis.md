`1 00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,280`
Så, ni lyssnar på Säkerhetspodcasten som transmitteras från Securityfest 2019 och vi har bara gått av staden.



`2 00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:22,000`
Det här är Robin von Post som pratar med Säkerhetspodcasten och jag sitter här tillsammans med Shira Shaman. Välkomna till Säkerhetspodcasten\!



`3 00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,480`
Tack så mycket\! Det är en glädje att vara här, seriöst\!



`4 00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:33,120`
Det är faktiskt vårt bästa glädje att ha dig på Securityfest och också på Säkerhetspodcasten.



`5 00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:33,580`
Tack\!



`6 00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:39,820`
Du kom just av staden och gjorde keynote-adressen här, sätter staden för resten av språkarna, eller hur?



`7 00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,620`
Ja, jag hoppas att jag har ställt barna eller satt dem i ett bra ställe.



`8 00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:51,640`
Barna är på rätt nivå och jag är säker på att de kommer att ha stora utmaningar när de kommer över det.



`9 00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,340`
Så vi är väldigt glada att ha dig här.



`10 00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,860`
Och vi kommer att följa upp lite på dina berättelser.



`11 00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:03,640`
Vad var det största tematet? Hur skulle du kalla det i en elevator-pitch?



`12 00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:16,980`
Jag skulle säga att jag gillar att prata om statens sponsrade attacker, de motiver som är bakom dem och de skillnader som finns mellan dem och kriminalhackarna som vi är mer vänliga med.



`13 00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:21,060`
Ja, och ge oss lite om din bakgrund.



`14 00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,600`
För du kom på staden för en anledning, eller hur?



`15 00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:31,600`
Ja, jag tror att jag kom på staden för att jag har en militär bakgrund.



`16 00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:44,600`
Jag ser bara ut som blå och lätt, men jag är major i det israelska IDF och jag började min karriär i intelligenskorpsen.



`17 00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:50,000`
I början var jag analyserare, men jag tog upp olika rörelser i olika delar.



`18 00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000`
Jag tog upp olika rörelser i olika delar.



`19 00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,620`
Jag tog upp olika rörelser i olika delar.



`20 00:01:52,620 --> 00:02:06,040`
Jag tog också upp officerstidig träning, och på ett visst sätt kom jag till en unit som kallas 8200, som är det israeliska signal- och intelligensuniteten och cyberuniteten.



`21 00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:11,840`
Okej, så du hör mycket om alla dessa olika operationer om staden över världen.



`22 00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:19,580`
Och Israel är en av de största spelarna, så vi är väldigt glada att ha dig här för att prata om det här.



`23 00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,960`
Det är inte ett öppet värld.



`24 00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,560`
I think a lot of experience and insight goes into your presentation.



`25 00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:31,740`
And it went live on YouTube and there is a possibility to see your whole talk there as well.



`26 00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:37,820`
But let's dive a little bit more into the details here.



`27 00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,260`
Questions arise.



`28 00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:44,880`
And one thing, the challenge for a state-sponsored attack,



`29 00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:48,700`
you were talking about why they do it.



`30 00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:55,400`
I mean, comparing the criminal gangsters or the motivations for just financial...



`31 00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,460`
Yeah, so we can understand the criminal hackers better, I guess.



`32 00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:05,700`
Because, first of all, their hacks are more known than the state-sponsored attacks.



`33 00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,000`
So we understand that hackers usually are after the money.



`34 00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,840`
So they will cause the damage and get the data that will get them the money.



`35 00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,860`
Either breaking into a bank or a stock exchange



`36 00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,680`
and getting the money.



`37 00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:24,100`
Or stealing private data that they can sell



`38 00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,340`
or use in other ways to get money.



`39 00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:31,600`
But at the end of the day, we're talking about getting richer in general.



`40 00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,780`
Or even sell your capabilities to other countries



`41 00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,280`
but in order to get money.



`42 00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,280`
You care about the money, less about the motives.



`43 00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,540`
And compared to that, the state-sponsored attacks are way more interesting



`44 00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:48,360`
because they have so many different and secret motives.



`45 00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,140`
Like the house of cards kind of thing.



`46 00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,260`
You do one thing because you mean to do another thing.



`47 00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,060`
It's a very complicated ecosystem.



`48 00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:06,100`
So one country might want to get information about their neighbors,



`49 00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,660`
which they're good friends with.



`50 00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:12,380`
They're not in a war, but they want to understand better about their economics,



`51 00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,660`
about their foreign affairs with the third country,



`52 00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,640`
about different interests that they have around.



`53 00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:24,640`
So this is one kind of an interest that two countries have in the cyber domain.



`54 00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:32,760`
Another interest might be that one country wants to get another country's intellectual property



`55 00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:39,360`
because they want to build factories that make better products.



`56 00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,540`
They want to get a piece of that market.



`57 00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,220`
Or they want to have better factories and so on.



`58 00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,460`
So they want to know.



`59 00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:52,800`
All your intellectual property secrets, they break into universities,



`60 00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,720`
they break into the factories and get that kind of information.



`61 00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:04,300`
But after all, it's financial motives on that level, but it's on a higher level.



`62 00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,760`
It's like a state-level money.



`63 00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,380`
And it doesn't look legitimate.



`64 00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:13,180`
I mean, when two criminals do it to one another, of course it's not legitimate.



`65 00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:18,200`
But when a country does that, it seems a lot more not legitimate.



`66 00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:24,680`
And then we also have the cyber warfare for war purposes.



`67 00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,380`
So if in the past we used to see bombs explode,



`68 00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,640`
today we see countries that cause damage in the digital domain,



`69 00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,520`
not in the physical domain.



`70 00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,340`
They do it in many different ways.



`71 00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,940`
One way would be, and I think one of the more popular ways,



`72 00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,340`
would be to cause people...



`73 00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:54,560`
They're horrified, they're afraid, they feel unsafe in their own homes.



`74 00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,540`
How is this done?



`75 00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,660`
By shutting down electricity, by shutting down communications



`76 00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:06,020`
and making it look like an accident or a misconfiguration.



`77 00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:11,760`
But when weird things start to happen and you're not getting serious answers,



`78 00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,860`
you get worried.



`79 00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,380`
And usually the country that is suffering from these kind of attacks,



`80 00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:22,300`
they don't hurry to confirm that they've been hacked.



`81 00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,920`
Because unlike other kinds of attacks, this is not very easy to prevent



`82 00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,940`
and not easy to protect your citizens against.



`83 00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:37,380`
But you lose trust, right, in your management of the country, so to speak.



`84 00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,240`
Exactly.



`85 00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:45,380`
So coming into that, you were talking a little bit about Ukraine and the attack on that.



`86 00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,240`
Would you say that there is a specific...



`87 00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:55,520`
A specific motive to have the citizens or the Ukraine people



`88 00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,320`
to lose trust in the country in that operation?



`89 00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:06,600`
So to our understanding, this was a hack made by the Russian government



`90 00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,920`
or people working for the Russian government on their behalf.



`91 00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:16,060`
And assuming this is true, then I understand that Russia and Ukraine



`92 00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,700`
have their own issues.



`93 00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,940`
And problems with one another.



`94 00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:28,740`
But Russia decided to use the cyber domain as another place where they can influence.



`95 00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:33,200`
And not only by taking over land and real estate,



`96 00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,780`
but also by making people know who's the boss around here.



`97 00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:42,300`
So even if we didn't take over the whole country,



`98 00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,060`
we're letting you know that we control the electricity.



`99 00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,580`
With no electricity, people are going...



`100 00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,960`
You're going to die in hospitals.



`101 00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,880`
And you will not have access to your most basic needs.



`102 00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:58,900`
This is going back 100 years with no electricity.



`103 00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:02,400`
This was the Russians way of saying to the Ukrainian people,



`104 00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:03,920`
We're here.



`105 00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,680`
And to my understanding, this might have another layer of meaning.



`106 00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:15,980`
Because Russia has had its own issues with other countries in Europe and in the world.



`107 00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,580`
And I don't think that...



`108 00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,100`
They would easily go and attack.



`109 00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:28,300`
I believe they hack, but they don't create an effect in other Western countries.



`110 00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:33,700`
So this is their way of saying, listen, we can do the same to you.



`111 00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,460`
So don't mess with us.



`112 00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:42,140`
And one interesting part about the Ukraine attack was actually that they left a backdoor.



`113 00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:46,600`
And that was something that you brought up a couple of times when you speak around the Easter eggs.



`114 00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,600`
Or always leave a backdoor.



`115 00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,520`
Yes.



`116 00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:56,640`
So when a state is conducting a hack, they always leave reinfectibility.



`117 00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,820`
They always make sure they can get back there if they need to.



`118 00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,020`
And continue from where they stopped.



`119 00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:12,380`
And the Easter egg is not just getting the backdoor to where you want to be.



`120 00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:16,040`
This is actually leaving some kind of code that can cause damage.



`121 00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,040`
And I can...



`122 00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:18,600`
Like a bomb.



`123 00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,400`
I can activate it from far away.



`124 00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:28,400`
So I can leave Trojan horses or backdoors or malicious code in different places.



`125 00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,900`
And if you piss me off at some point, I will just activate it.



`126 00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,960`
And this is the whole purpose of the Easter egg.



`127 00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,020`
I will use it when I find it.



`128 00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:42,160`
So we're getting into a cold war again about don't mess with me because we know you can mess with you.



`129 00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:42,600`
Yeah.



`130 00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,800`
As we said on the talk, from the dirty bomb to the dirty worm.



`131 00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:47,200`
Yeah.



`132 00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:56,820`
So also one item that you brought up was the hacking back issue about, I mean...



`133 00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,680`
Attack the attackers.



`134 00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,680`
Attack the attackers.



`135 00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:02,940`
What's your, I mean, from your military background, what's your feeling?



`136 00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:10,820`
Because it's quite a hot potato in this area to discuss, I guess.



`137 00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:18,640`
Because there is so many both ethical and practical issues around hacking.



`138 00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,500`
Yes.



`139 00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:24,480`
If necessary, then I think it's legitimate.



`140 00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:31,260`
I think that hacking the hackers is a good way of getting to the source of things.



`141 00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:40,320`
And actually, I think that a lot of researchers that were published by, you know, well-known security companies,



`142 00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,960`
they were able to publish them because they got to the source.



`143 00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,000`
They got to the hackers.



`144 00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:48,200`
And this is where they actually saw the source code.



`145 00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:48,260`
And this is where they actually saw the source code.



`146 00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:48,680`
And this is where they actually saw the source code.



`147 00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,280`
And the IP addresses of the people who got attacked.



`148 00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:00,020`
So this was a great way of understanding the whole story behind one piece of malware they found somewhere.



`149 00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:10,120`
It wouldn't surprise me if, you know, a company publishes a very nice white paper about a hacking campaign.



`150 00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:15,920`
The whole white paper began because they were tipped off by another government to do that.



`151 00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,240`
But attacking the attackers enabled...



`152 00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:24,400`
You access to the attacking tools, to information about whoever it was that got attacked.



`153 00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,140`
So sometimes you even find victims.



`154 00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:29,600`
You had no idea that they were even victims.



`155 00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,820`
And the victims have no idea that they are victims.



`156 00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:40,560`
So it's a good way of understanding the whole campaign, finding the tools, finding who got attacked, and getting the whole story behind it.



`157 00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:46,340`
But if you want to hack back, you need to have your tools or you need to have the abilities to do it.



`158 00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,600`
And, I mean, you could buy those...



`159 00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:54,260`
You could buy those capabilities or you can develop them yourself and find vulnerabilities.



`160 00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,980`
And that's where one discussion comes up, of course.



`161 00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,760`
You knew all along about this SMB attack on Windows.



`162 00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,160`
Why didn't you say anything?



`163 00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,100`
It brought down our own country.



`164 00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:07,660`
Yes.



`165 00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:14,360`
Now, this is taking us to another question about responsibility of the software companies, right?



`166 00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,600`
So you have...



`167 00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,360`
If you use Windows on your computer...



`168 00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,620`
Why did you expect Microsoft to feel reliable to you?



`169 00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:29,140`
Unfortunately, our software suppliers are not feeling reliable to our privacy enough.



`170 00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,160`
Because we hear about hacks all the time.



`171 00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:41,060`
You know, a couple of years ago, Uber, who lost 57 million usernames and passwords to hackers.



`172 00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,800`
Did you stop using Uber?



`173 00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,060`
No.



`174 00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:46,720`
No, I know.



`175 00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,540`
I know many people did not stop using Uber.



`176 00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,140`
Because it's comfortable and we still want to use it.



`177 00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,300`
We did not punish Uber for that.



`178 00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,960`
And we did not punish Microsoft for other things.



`179 00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:02,300`
We did not punish a lot of other companies that hurt our privacy and did not inform us about this.



`180 00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,700`
We did not punish Yahoo.



`181 00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,180`
Yahoo were sold to Verizon.



`182 00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,780`
Verizon got a small discount.



`183 00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:11,160`
But Yahoo's stock did not get hurt by this.



`184 00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,340`
They only went up.



`185 00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,540`
But are people still using Yahoo?



`186 00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,040`
It's a good question.



`187 00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:15,700`
It's a good point.



`188 00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,560`
And surprisingly enough, every now and then, I still see...



`189 00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,340`
I see people using a Yahoo-domain.



`190 00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,580`
This is true.



`191 00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:26,460`
But still, so how come their stock is only on the rise?



`192 00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:32,420`
But one current issue is around all the Facebook situations that have been around.



`193 00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,480`
And I mean, people are still there.



`194 00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,720`
They still want to get invited to parties.



`195 00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,160`
Of course.



`196 00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,020`
Of course, we are also addicted.



`197 00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,640`
So it's hard for us to stop.



`198 00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:48,240`
I think that in the near future, we will see governments enforcing policies.



`199 00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,980`
This is about privacy.



`200 00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,300`
We already see this with the GDPR.



`201 00:13:52,880 --> 00:14:01,080`
And we will be seeing that more and more until software companies will learn to respect our privacy.



`202 00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,900`
They're making a lot of money out of our data, right?



`203 00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:08,600`
We get special ads because yesterday you googled, I don't know, sneakers.



`204 00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:13,300`
So today you keep on getting advertisements about cool shoes.



`205 00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,620`
This is how they make money.



`206 00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,940`
And we get free software.



`207 00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:17,940`
We get free stuff.



`208 00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,360`
We get storage space in Google Drive.



`209 00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:25,260`
And we get Facebook and all the other stuff we are totally addicted to.



`210 00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,820`
And we pay with our privacy.



`211 00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,880`
And it's time to find a new equation.



`212 00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:38,020`
But still, I mean, one of my main concerns is even when you pay for something, you could still pay with your privacy.



`213 00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:38,660`
It's not that.



`214 00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,300`
This is true.



`215 00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,660`
So you both lose your privacy and your money.



`216 00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,020`
You're absolutely right.



`217 00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,700`
And this is bad.



`218 00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,120`
This shouldn't be this way.



`219 00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:55,800`
And I'm looking forward to our governments enforcing stronger policies about our privacies.



`220 00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:00,060`
It's rather annoying that we need the government to enforce that.



`221 00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,660`
And that the companies just don't feel reliable to our data.



`222 00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:09,820`
Because I'm keeping my data with you and I expect you not to use it at all.



`223 00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:10,620`
It's mine.



`224 00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:12,560`
True that.



`225 00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:17,240`
If we come back a little bit to the more targeted attacks, so to speak.



`226 00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,120`
I mean.



`227 00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:26,300`
When the Snowden revelations were done, the tools were quite sophisticated, the implants and the details about that.



`228 00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:30,140`
But then, of course, you said something in the beginning.



`229 00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:34,620`
We talk about not using all your tools everywhere, right?



`230 00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:39,820`
So it's about not spreading the butter too thin on the sandwich.



`231 00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:47,440`
How would you say, how afraid should I be as a common citizen in a country?



`232 00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,440`
On the one hand.



`233 00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,140`
Being targeted by an implant in my computer.



`234 00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,320`
So this is a question I get asked often.



`235 00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,900`
Because when I talk to people about awareness, they tell me, yeah, but I don't have anything interesting on my computer.



`236 00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,600`
I have no secrets.



`237 00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:07,760`
If someone wants my nude pictures, I will feel uncomfortable, but whatever.



`238 00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,360`
So people say that all the time.



`239 00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,200`
And on the one hand, it's true.



`240 00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,140`
But there are a few problems.



`241 00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,520`
One problem is that if this does happen.



`242 00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:30,320`
And someone will duplicate your identity and go and open a bank account on behalf of you and take your money and run away and no one will be able to find them.



`243 00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,920`
This will be a serious problem for you.



`244 00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:38,420`
I think that in the US, this is already a problem because fraud there is a little easier.



`245 00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,860`
And this affects your credit score.



`246 00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:42,520`
Yeah.



`247 00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:42,900`
Right.



`248 00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:46,060`
So if your credit card was stolen, it happens.



`249 00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,360`
You would probably just cancel it.



`250 00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,120`
And get your credit company to get you a new one.



`251 00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:57,100`
And in the US, if they registered that the card was canceled, no matter what the reason was.



`252 00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,700`
So this affects your credit score.



`253 00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,200`
Because the credit score company, they don't care if it was canceled because you didn't pay your bills.



`254 00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,580`
Or because the card was stolen.



`255 00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,900`
So next time you go and get a mortgage, this will hurt you.



`256 00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:12,420`
This is one problem.



`257 00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:15,200`
The other problem is the problem of scale.



`258 00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,100`
Right.



`259 00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,420`
We talked about devices with a benchmark.



`260 00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,040`
Backdoor.



`261 00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:22,340`
Should we or should we not buy Chinese cell phones and computers?



`262 00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:27,000`
And the problem here is with the scale of the impact.



`263 00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:33,700`
If one million Swedish people will have a Chinese computer and all the computers has a backdoor.



`264 00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,440`
And from the backdoor, you can get to other places.



`265 00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,100`
Because maybe you and I share the same Wi-Fi network.



`266 00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,860`
And from your computer, someone can get to my computer.



`267 00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,760`
So at some point, it will proliferate.



`268 00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,860`
And the Chinese or someone else can get...



`269 00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:54,800`
Theoretically get access to many areas we did not intend to give them access to.



`270 00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,040`
So it's not about your data.



`271 00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:03,600`
It's about the access that they get by using your computer as a router.



`272 00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:11,760`
So even if I'm just a normal citizen, I can be like a proxy towards a more interesting target, so to speak.



`273 00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,220`
Unfortunately, I think so.



`274 00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:13,900`
Yeah, okay.



`275 00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,640`
That makes sense.



`276 00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,500`
So you should keep your heads up.



`277 00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,480`
Even if you're not...



`278 00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,480`
A specific target in that sense.



`279 00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:27,880`
And there are always things that even common people who are not security professionals can do to protect themselves.



`280 00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:33,140`
Of course, if anyone wants to target them for some reason, they can do it.



`281 00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:37,000`
But being responsible and not reusing passwords, for example.



`282 00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,060`
This is something that most people, they don't do.



`283 00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,060`
They reuse passwords.



`284 00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:45,480`
They have the same password to their Facebook and LinkedIn and bank account.



`285 00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,140`
And then, you know, LinkedIn gets hacked.



`286 00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,080`
And a few hundred millions of passwords are leaked.



`287 00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:58,900`
And that database of usernames and passwords is still used today.



`288 00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,900`
I think it happened in 2016.



`289 00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,160`
And it's still used until today.



`290 00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,600`
Because these are very good passwords for dictionary attacks.



`291 00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,160`
Absolutely.



`292 00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:15,100`
I mean, the password spraying situation that will obviously happen to all my kind of sources.



`293 00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:17,600`
So...



`294 00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,100`
I think...



`295 00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,720`
Your talk was really interesting.



`296 00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,360`
Because, I mean, we're talking financial motives.



`297 00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:26,540`
We're talking about the state financial motives.



`298 00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,800`
And a lot of the people down in the crowd are, of course, working every day with security issues.



`299 00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,200`
Trying to figure out how big of a threat is this and not.



`300 00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:38,940`
And trying to figure out the impact and so on.



`301 00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:45,720`
And I think your talk gave a good backdrop to the whole sessions down here.



`302 00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,420`
So I appreciate you taking your time to come to Sweden.



`303 00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,660`
Thank you very much.



`304 00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:53,700`
Thank you very much for sharing more information with us on the Säkerhetspodcasten.



`305 00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:57,520`
On behalf of all the listeners, I would say a big thank you.



`306 00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,300`
Thank you.



`307 00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,780`
And welcome back next year.



`308 00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,780`
I hope to be back here with the sun.



`309 00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,940`
I'll bring the sun with me.



`310 00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:03,740`
Bring the sun.



`311 00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,560`
Do it, do it.



`312 00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,300`
Please do.



`313 00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,840`
Thank you very much.



`314 00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:15,580`
So, we are here just getting off stage on Security Fest 2019, day two.



`315 00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,580`
And the keynote address was...



`316 00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,940`
Made by Dave Lewis.



`317 00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,640`
And he's sitting here right in front of me.



`318 00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,440`
It's like a miracle coming true.



`319 00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,320`
You're a legend, right?



`320 00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,880`
I will never ascribe to that.



`321 00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:32,920`
But Dave, you're coming, flying in from a hectic schedule.



`322 00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,940`
You just arrived late last evening.



`323 00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,920`
And you're from Cisco.



`324 00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:40,500`
Yep.



`325 00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,740`
Acquired Duo.



`326 00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,680`
Yeah, Duo Security.



`327 00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,680`
We were acquired by Cisco back October 1st, 2018.



`328 00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,180`
And yeah, so it's been quite a wild ride.



`329 00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,180`
I can imagine, I can imagine.



`330 00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:55,980`
And the layout of your talk, the elevator pitch, so to speak, would be?



`331 00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:59,340`
So, the way I look at it is zero trust in the flaming sword of justice



`332 00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:02,840`
is really comparing and contrasting what people are talking about



`333 00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,640`
as a zero trust conversation today



`334 00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,600`
versus the way security was historically done.



`335 00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,340`
And the whole idea here is that we can do a better job



`336 00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,360`
with the resources that we have



`337 00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,300`
in a much more succinct fashion than we have prior to now.



`338 00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:17,680`
Yeah.



`339 00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,080`
So, one of your slides says that we're actually, like, redefining the perimeter.



`340 00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:28,960`
It's one of the key issues here regarding the data and the trust in the data.



`341 00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,140`
So, zero trust.



`342 00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:39,160`
What would you say has driven this change in the last five, ten years?



`343 00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:44,320`
So, a lot of the discussion has, well, it's basically taking all of the resources



`344 00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,000`
that we've had at our disposal for a very, very long time



`345 00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,420`
and doing a much better job.



`346 00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,220`
It's a much better job of implementing them and leveraging them



`347 00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:54,200`
so that we are making sure that people only have access



`348 00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,060`
to what they absolutely need to have access to.



`349 00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,860`
Only devices that are supposed to be accessing your network are accessing it.



`350 00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:03,440`
And only people that are supposed to be accessing the applications



`351 00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,900`
are the applications are then also being controlled



`352 00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:09,260`
so that, you know, random individuals from Canada and other places



`353 00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:13,200`
aren't just nefariously logging into your resources in Sweden.



`354 00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:13,660`
Yeah.



`355 00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:17,540`
So, what would you say, how did you manage that ten years ago?



`356 00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:18,380`
Well.



`357 00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,980`
And ten years ago, that's just it.



`358 00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,160`
We've had all these pieces.



`359 00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,640`
We've had network zone segmentation.



`360 00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,040`
We've had asset inventories.



`361 00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,180`
We've had user management.



`362 00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:29,240`
But we just haven't had a clear drive to do it in a cohesive fashion.



`363 00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,680`
And over time, we tend to chase the next shiny thing.



`364 00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,920`
So, now, we're looking at, you know, back in 2010,



`365 00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,520`
John Kindervog, who was an analyst at Forrester at the time,



`366 00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:39,880`
coined the term zero trust.



`367 00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,580`
And it has really gotten people's attention.



`368 00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:47,740`
People are paying attention to something they should have been paying attention to all along,



`369 00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,240`
which is great.



`370 00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,780`
That is fantastic.



`371 00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,520`
And now, I think it's time for us to evolve from that



`372 00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,240`
and start talking more about trusted access



`373 00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,800`
and put more of a positive connotation as opposed to zero trust.



`374 00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,200`
Because when you're talking zero trust within technical terms,



`375 00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,680`
people, they'll get it.



`376 00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,200`
But if you're talking to folks that are not technically savvy,



`377 00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,600`
they will tend to say,



`378 00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,620`
it sounds like a negative connotation.



`379 00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:12,120`
So, I prefer to move it, start moving it towards a trusted access discussion.



`380 00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:12,520`
Yeah.



`381 00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:16,880`
So, trusted access is a more fine-grained now, I guess, then.



`382 00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:17,960`
Well, yeah.



`383 00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,700`
It's basically the same thing,



`384 00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,660`
just calling it something a little bit more positive



`385 00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:26,020`
because you want it to resound or reverberate rather through the C-suite



`386 00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,040`
so that they see it as a positive



`387 00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,020`
and something that can help reduce costs



`388 00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:33,080`
and secure the environment in a more sane, cohesive fashion.



`389 00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:37,400`
But when you go from like the perimeter firewall era



`390 00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:42,960`
to the fine-grained asset-based trust stuff,



`391 00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,080`
you also get a lot of administration



`392 00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,840`
or could end up in administration, I guess.



`393 00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,300`
Well, that is very true.



`394 00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,220`
There is that possibility.



`395 00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,900`
But there are tools out there that can help facilitate that in a sane fashion.



`396 00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,100`
I mean, yes, the old way of doing it, of having,



`397 00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,940`
it's okay, everything's fine, we have a firewall.



`398 00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,380`
That was a demonstrably broken notion at the time.



`399 00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:06,620`
During my talk, I make an analogy to the fall of Rome in 410 AD



`400 00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:10,720`
where the attackers, the Visigoths, were able to take over the city



`401 00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,700`
by using their own security against them.



`402 00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,040`
So, the idea of the traditional perimeter approach



`403 00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,940`
was proven demonstrably broken in 410 AD.



`404 00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,140`
And unfortunately, we see a lot of companies



`405 00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,340`
are still implementing that now.



`406 00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,100`
The reality is, is the perimeter is now anywhere



`407 00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,660`
and access decision is being made.



`408 00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,760`
So, we have to pivot from that.



`409 00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,820`
And yes, there is some overhead to managing it, absolutely.



`410 00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:34,180`
And with anything new, there is going to be growing pains.



`411 00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,440`
So, we are really shifting the collective consciousness



`412 00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,500`
away from the perimeter model to a much better decentralized approach.



`413 00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:47,520`
Yeah, and I guess that I'm not sure how many active directors



`414 00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,500`
you've seen with the perfect match between the policies



`415 00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:55,300`
and the right, how it should be and how it is, right?



`416 00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,700`
Well, I can count that on no fingers.



`417 00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,820`
Yeah, and we're out of fingers.



`418 00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,340`
That's a tough one.



`419 00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,780`
So, I guess you need something that is correct, right?



`420 00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:09,480`
In order to accept that you have internet on your home yard.



`421 00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,780`
Well, yeah, exactly.



`422 00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,920`
And being able to have a clear understanding



`423 00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,420`
as to the assets in your environment



`424 00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,920`
as well as the users in your environment.



`425 00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:16,920`
That is a big...



`426 00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,840`
That is a battle that has been going on forever.



`427 00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,480`
After the talk today, I spoke to a couple of individuals



`428 00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,680`
that were telling me about how their asset inventories



`429 00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,000`
in their organizations are being run with Excel spreadsheets.



`430 00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,040`
And they're not alone.



`431 00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,480`
There are many companies out there that still do this.



`432 00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,680`
And there are many resources out there



`433 00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,960`
that can help you facilitate this



`434 00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,680`
in a much more sane and cohesive fashion.



`435 00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,420`
Some of them might rhyme with Duo.



`436 00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,620`
Sorry, that was blatant.



`437 00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:44,020`
But yeah, there are all kinds of resources out there



`438 00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,140`
that can help you do a better job.



`439 00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,500`
Yeah, but then the C-level,



`440 00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,440`
needs to understand that there is a shift



`441 00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,740`
and that you need to invest in those kinds of tools, I guess.



`442 00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,060`
Well, and that's the truth of it.



`443 00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,620`
And within the security circles,



`444 00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,880`
we have to evolve in order to be taken seriously.



`445 00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:02,100`
I mean, we are proverbially the dog that has caught the bumper.



`446 00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,540`
And now we have to try and figure out what to do with it.



`447 00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,020`
So the C-suite is now paying attention.



`448 00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,100`
We want to make sure that we're articulating a message



`449 00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:12,140`
that is sane because if we start barking at them,



`450 00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,400`
they're not going to listen.



`451 00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,340`
They're going to go deaf.



`452 00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,560`
If we can speak to them in terms they understand,



`453 00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:16,660`
they're going to understand.



`454 00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:16,700`
They're going to understand.



`455 00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:16,800`
They're going to understand.



`456 00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,040`
They're going to understand.



`457 00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:17,060`
They're going to understand.



`458 00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:17,220`
They're going to understand.



`459 00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:17,280`
They're going to understand.



`460 00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,060`
We're talking about risk and things to that effect.



`461 00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,360`
And consequences of not having it correct.



`462 00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:22,640`
Exactly.



`463 00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,280`
And you want them to buy in.



`464 00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,900`
So you want to make sure that now that you have their attention



`465 00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:27,500`
that you keep it.



`466 00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:27,860`
Yeah.



`467 00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,620`
So you don't jump up on the horse in the wrong direction



`468 00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:33,480`
and try to ride away, but you steer slowly.



`469 00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:37,160`
But is there a way to do like a gradient transition



`470 00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:40,960`
to trust or to the access-based networking?



`471 00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,600`
Honestly, in order to do that, yes.



`472 00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,860`
You do have to look at it as an incremental approach.



`473 00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:46,100`
Yeah.



`474 00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:46,980`
Because if you try to do all of that,



`475 00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,680`
do all or nothing,



`476 00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,600`
you're basically setting yourself up for failure.



`477 00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,420`
If you could do it in an incremental fashion,



`478 00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:54,380`
you can then celebrate each win as you go along



`479 00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,840`
because otherwise you could get yourself



`480 00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,820`
into a world of hurt.



`481 00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,540`
And so literally picking and prioritizing as you go along.



`482 00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,560`
Most companies, the easiest way to start



`483 00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,880`
is dealing with an asset inventory,



`484 00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,480`
then dealing with user management,



`485 00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,600`
and then incrementally growing from there.



`486 00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,800`
You really want to make sure



`487 00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,500`
that you don't try to bite it off



`488 00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,560`
and do it all at the same time



`489 00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,740`
because you simply can't.



`490 00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:21,560`
The boiling the ocean was a well-received message



`491 00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,020`
in your talk as well, I guess.



`492 00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,840`
We tried to do that too many times.



`493 00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,220`
Yes.



`494 00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,380`
I've been guilty of that as well.



`495 00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:31,340`
So if we come to one of the quite,



`496 00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,000`
in the recent news,



`497 00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,960`
we had the issue with Salesforce



`498 00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,420`
being down for like a couple of days.



`499 00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:38,660`
Yes.



`500 00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,560`
So I'm pretty sure you heard about it.



`501 00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:44,080`
But what happened there was really



`502 00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,340`
that their access management broke down.



`503 00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:49,480`
They deployed into a production script



`504 00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,780`
that wide opened a lot of files in some way.



`505 00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,160`
I didn't see the details.



`506 00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:00,900`
But I mean, that's one kind of trust access network,



`507 00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:01,760`
the Salesforce,



`508 00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,960`
where everyone from every company connects, right?



`509 00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:05,300`
Yeah.



`510 00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,620`
And then zero trust.



`511 00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,560`
I mean, it's a lot of trust networking



`512 00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,560`
that you put stuff in the cloud in that way.



`513 00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:13,960`
Yeah.



`514 00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,920`
And that's why I prefer to talk about trusted access.



`515 00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:16,260`
Yeah.



`516 00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:16,720`
Because it helps.



`517 00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,400`
It helps frame it in more of a positive light.



`518 00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:23,260`
And the Salesforce example is just pointing out



`519 00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,580`
that it can happen to anybody.



`520 00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,160`
And the thing is you want to make sure



`521 00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,520`
that you have a defined, repeatable process



`522 00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,060`
that you can handle when something like that does happen.



`523 00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,740`
I've been through various organizations



`524 00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,400`
where we all suffered oopses along the way



`525 00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,420`
or misconfigurations or whatever it happens to be.



`526 00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,720`
And you just have to be able to learn



`527 00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,600`
how to get ahead of the narrative.



`528 00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,300`
Otherwise, the narrative will get ahead of you.



`529 00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,600`
And that's not going to serve



`530 00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,300`
anybody any positive night.



`531 00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:49,260`
No, exactly.



`532 00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,760`
Because what I'm saying is that



`533 00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,420`
trust takes years to build,



`534 00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,240`
seconds to ruin,



`535 00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,400`
and forever to repair.



`536 00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,500`
Couldn't have said that better myself.



`537 00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,580`
It's not me saying that.



`538 00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,540`
It's a proverb, I guess.



`539 00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,640`
It is, but it's very apt.



`540 00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,740`
Then another thing you brought up was web of them.



`541 00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:05,240`
Yes.



`542 00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,200`
The thing that should bring you from the presentation.



`543 00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,700`
And the presentation will be live on YouTube



`544 00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,280`
to look at.



`545 00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:15,080`
So all the listeners that want to go into detail there



`546 00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,060`
can look at it.



`547 00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:19,540`
What would you say is the main disruptive thing



`548 00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,360`
about web of them?



`549 00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,660`
So web of them is allowing you to do



`550 00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,700`
passwordless authentication.



`551 00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:24,720`
So you're able to use



`552 00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,380`
multi-factor authentication for websites.



`553 00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,620`
So if you're going to internet banking,



`554 00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,740`
you're able to have a push come to your device



`555 00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,680`
and you can say yes or no



`556 00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,200`
as to whether or not you want to gain access



`557 00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,380`
to that particular website



`558 00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:36,020`
as opposed to typing any username and password.



`559 00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:39,280`
Because there's too many phishing sites out there



`560 00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:39,900`
as an example.



`561 00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,080`
And there's too many opportunities



`562 00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,720`
for static passwords to be purloined



`563 00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,700`
by negative actors.



`564 00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,040`
And there's too many opportunities for static passwords to be purloined by negative actors.



`565 00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,800`
This is a better way to do it



`566 00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,600`
in such a way that it is far, far more difficult



`567 00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,000`
for an attacker



`568 00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,960`
to gain access to your resources.



`569 00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,660`
Nothing's ever 100%



`570 00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,780`
but this is far better than what we currently have.



`571 00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,660`
Yeah, we have some kind of standard now



`572 00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,500`
to hold on to, so to speak.



`573 00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,140`
And it's an open standard, which I'm all about.



`574 00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,100`
Pro that, pro that.



`575 00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:08,640`
Very much.



`576 00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:13,060`
Then you also brought up the supply chain issue, of course.



`577 00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,080`
It's really hot



`578 00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,180`
and I mean it's hitting



`579 00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,580`
companies where it hurts



`580 00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:18,860`
and where they're soft, right?



`581 00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,800`
Because you trust your suppliers.



`582 00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,280`
How can you live in this world



`583 00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,000`
without trusting your suppliers?



`584 00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,320`
What are we saying?



`585 00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,880`
What's on the labels in the box?



`586 00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:31,860`
Yeah.



`587 00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,020`
This is one of those things with supply chain



`588 00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,720`
and it's really funny that it's all hot now



`589 00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,520`
because I gave my first supply chain security talk



`590 00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,240`
back in 2013.



`591 00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:41,880`
And this is something I was tub-thumping for a very long time about.



`592 00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,640`
Because the attackers



`593 00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,960`
are shifting how they attack companies.



`594 00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,440`
How they attack organizations.



`595 00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,380`
How they attack governments.



`596 00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,340`
They have gone away from being able to hit you in the face



`597 00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,940`
as opposed to trying to pick your pocket.



`598 00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,420`
So you really have to be able to



`599 00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,720`
be monitoring all these different aspects.



`600 00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,040`
Is code being accidentally introduced



`601 00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,080`
into your organization



`602 00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,680`
that either nefariously has



`603 00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,440`
negative instructions in it



`604 00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,560`
or accidentally?



`605 00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,120`
And this is just one example of many.



`606 00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,060`
There's great companies out there like SNIC



`607 00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:14,360`
that can monitor the libraries



`608 00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,660`
that you're using in your organization.



`609 00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:16,500`
Look and say,



`610 00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,500`
okay, these individual applications,



`611 00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,980`
there's a security problem with them.



`612 00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,720`
We need to update it in our own packages.



`613 00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,400`
So that's just one example of many.



`614 00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,800`
So the DevOps way of developing



`615 00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,760`
needs to apply new tools



`616 00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,640`
as well then to



`617 00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,680`
be more resistant to these kinds of



`618 00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,760`
threats or risks.



`619 00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,700`
Yes, you want to build security into your pipeline.



`620 00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:38,040`
You want to make sure that it is part of the process



`621 00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,000`
as opposed to



`622 00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,500`
the good old fashioned flaming sword of justice.



`623 00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,760`
How do we get to know?



`624 00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,460`
That doesn't serve anybody well.



`625 00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,940`
And in DevOps, you've got to move,



`626 00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:46,340`
fast,



`627 00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,140`
and you have to be agile.



`628 00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,860`
And when you're dealing with that sort of environment,



`629 00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,960`
you want to make sure that security is baked in



`630 00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,720`
from the word go



`631 00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,720`
and you're making sure



`632 00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,560`
that you're not accidentally introducing



`633 00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,700`
vulnerabilities that could impact your customers,



`634 00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,120`
citizens, whatever it happens to be.



`635 00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,160`
Yeah, because I mean,



`636 00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,700`
there's so many global services now



`637 00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,200`
so you could have a global impact



`638 00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,740`
if you're putting anything in production.



`639 00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,840`
So just having a control of your impact level



`640 00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,880`
is a way of understanding



`641 00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,880`
how much effort you should put into this.



`642 00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:16,600`
Well, exactly.



`643 00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,840`
It's like a simple script or a simple error



`644 00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,420`
can have impact millions of people in the blink of an eye.



`645 00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:22,520`
Here's a close-up.



`646 00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:26,580`
And the need to focus on this



`647 00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,920`
is definitely far higher than it's ever been.



`648 00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,400`
Yeah, indeed.



`649 00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,660`
So Dave, I appreciate you taking your time



`650 00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,480`
to come to Cyclesport Kostn



`651 00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,040`
and especially coming to Gothenburg



`652 00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,240`
in this beautiful day.



`653 00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,540`
Gothenburg weather day.



`654 00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,260`
It's like Canadian weather.



`655 00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,260`
You've got to wait five minutes.



`656 00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,600`
Well, that's okay.



`657 00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,180`
I'll wait.



`658 00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,840`
But thank you very much for having me.



`659 00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,120`
Yeah.



`660 00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,720`
Okay, so on behalf of Cyclesport Kostn listeners



`661 00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,500`
and my name is Ron von Post,



`662 00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,860`
the flag reporter for the crew here



`663 00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:59,660`
and I appreciate you all listening to this episode as well.



`664 00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,420`
Take care out there and have a nice day.
