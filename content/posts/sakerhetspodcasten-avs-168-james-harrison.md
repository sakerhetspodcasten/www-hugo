## Innehåll

I dagens avsnitt intervjuar vi James Harrison, ficktjuv och close-up magiker extraordinaire,
för att försöka ta reda på hur hans väldigt specifika skillset platsar på en säkerhetskonferens
som Sec-T. Hur går man till väga för att stjäla någons ID-bricka eller plånbok? Hur
kan man skydda sig själv och sina ägodelar?

`1 00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,920`
All right, hello and welcome back to this live-ish recording for SEC-T.



`2 00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:09,720`
This is of course Sackus Bukastin. I'm Johan de Bermudler. I'm here with Rickard Woodfors.



`3 00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:10,920`
As always.



`4 00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,200`
And James Harrison, right?



`5 00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,140`
Hello, yes.



`6 00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:13,660`
See?



`7 00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:14,120`
Awesome.



`8 00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,520`
Got a bit of a memory for names.



`9 00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:16,720`
Perfect.



`10 00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:17,820`
Nice to have you here, too.



`11 00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,480`
Thank you so much. Thanks for inviting me.



`12 00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,660`
Thanks for an awesome talk.



`13 00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,420`
Yeah, that was amazing. Incredible stuff.



`14 00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,420`
I'm glad you guys enjoyed it.



`15 00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,000`
It was magical.



`16 00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,300`
I hope there was something in there worth value to you.



`17 00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:28,160`
Yeah, definitely.



`18 00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,240`
Glad you enjoyed it.



`19 00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:41,160`
Just to introduce you to our viewers and listeners, you started out as a magician and slided over into pickpocketing.



`20 00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:41,640`
Yes.



`21 00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:42,560`
How did that happen?



`22 00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:49,240`
Well, I got into magic from the very beginning for me.



`23 00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:52,320`
It was a lot later in life than most people.



`24 00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:57,480`
Most people talk about how they got, oh, I got a magic kit for Christmas and that's how I knew I'd become a magician.



`25 00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,400`
I'm like, no.



`26 00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:05,960`
Before I got into magic, I was big into martial arts, multiple black belts, won competitions, the whole thing.



`27 00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,700`
And I blew my knee out and I was bedridden for six months.



`28 00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,880`
So I had a lot of free time on my hands.



`29 00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,940`
So I saw fall people David Blaine on television.



`30 00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:19,320`
Sure.



`31 00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,460`
And I was like, I always wanted to learn to do that.



`32 00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,460`
Let's learn to do that.



`33 00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,660`
So I started learning.



`34 00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:24,900`
Mm.



`35 00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:44,900`
Mm.



`36 00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,900`
Mm.



`37 00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,720`
Mm.



`38 00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:48,800`
Mm.



`39 00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,940`
Mm.



`40 00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,960`
Mm.



`41 00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,020`
Mm.



`42 00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,080`
Mm.



`43 00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,400`
Mm.



`44 00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:54,420`
Mm.



`45 00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:54,440`
Mm.



`46 00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:54,480`
Mm.



`47 00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:54,540`
Mm.



`48 00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:54,580`
Mm.



`49 00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:54,600`
Mm.



`50 00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:54,620`
Mm.



`51 00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:54,640`
Mm.



`52 00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:54,660`
Mm.



`53 00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:54,760`
Mm.



`54 00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,940`
genetic because as I was watching



`55 00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,840`
a video on how it worked



`56 00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,840`
back in the day, a great



`57 00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,720`
French film called Pickpocket, if you ever



`58 00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,680`
get a chance to watch it, just for watching the



`59 00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,880`
techniques, it's amazing.



`60 00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,740`
And my dad watched it and said it was so



`61 00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,320`
much easier back when I was a kid.



`62 00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:11,720`
What?



`63 00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:12,280`
What?



`64 00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,700`
He goes, yeah, I used to do this in high school, didn't I



`65 00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,760`
tell you that? And I'm like, no, no



`66 00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,980`
you did not. It was literally in your blood.



`67 00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,920`
Teach me, Obi-Wan, let's go.



`68 00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:24,820`
And so



`69 00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,060`
yeah, apparently it's genetic.



`70 00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,380`
The only difference is I found a way to



`71 00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,420`
do it and not go to jail.



`72 00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,600`
Yeah, I mean, it's similar to



`73 00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,640`
hacking in that sense. Like the IT



`74 00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,940`
security industry, a lot of people come from



`75 00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,800`
shady backgrounds.



`76 00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,640`
Well, you know, shady backgrounds or at least an



`77 00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,120`
interest may have started somewhere



`78 00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,900`
you know, as with pickpocketing,



`79 00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,640`
breaking into systems, but then figuring



`80 00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,280`
out how to do it legally.



`81 00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,100`
That's awesome.



`82 00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,600`
I mean, doing



`83 00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,760`
something you love and getting paid for it.



`84 00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,060`
Yes, there's always a better



`85 00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,100`
vocation than doing



`86 00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,320`
something you hate and just being miserable.



`87 00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:02,940`
Yeah.



`88 00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,680`
So, but for me, it's been a blast.



`89 00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,440`
I've enjoyed the conference and everyone's



`90 00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,060`
really polite, overly so.



`91 00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,360`
Well, they're still fairly sober, I think.



`92 00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,500`
That's, well, it should be different tonight then.



`93 00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,680`
I imagine that there's going to be some people



`94 00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,000`
trying to pick your pockets.



`95 00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,320`
That's why I brought this. I actually brought dummy phone



`96 00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:24,620`
Really?



`97 00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:29,840`
For people to try because I, well, I did at DEF CON.



`98 00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,300`
I do workshops so people can feel what it's like to do it



`99 00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,760`
because to protect yourself from it is one thing, but



`100 00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,160`
that's like, sort of like, I know self-defense by punching



`101 00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,000`
a punching bag.



`102 00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:44,920`
Right.



`103 00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,460`
You've never been punched back.



`104 00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,420`
Oh, well.



`105 00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,560`
Then you don't really know.



`106 00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,560`
Then you don't really know.



`107 00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,780`
So it's the same with pickpocketing.



`108 00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,300`
If you've never taken something out of someone's pocket, then



`109 00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,420`
you don't know what it's really like.



`110 00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:54,580`
Right.



`111 00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,020`
So you don't know what they'll feel for or look for.



`112 00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,000`
So that's why I like doing the workshops.



`113 00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:05,000`
Not so I have a rampant troop of pickpockets under my name,



`114 00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,120`
but for people just to be able to understand like,



`115 00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,460`
oh, that's what it's really like.



`116 00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,420`
This is how close someone has to really be.



`117 00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:12,960`
Yeah.



`118 00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:17,620`
Because a lot of people tend to be distracted or mystified



`119 00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:23,100`
with Hollywood on the romantic idea of how it works.



`120 00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,420`
And in reality, it's,



`121 00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:27,240`
it's much more down and dirty.



`122 00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,680`
But that's, I mean, you were talking a lot about that during your talk



`123 00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,860`
about getting into someone's personal space.



`124 00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:35,320`
Yes.



`125 00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:38,340`
And that is the major challenge.



`126 00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:42,660`
And also to distract them from what you're doing.



`127 00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,600`
You have to be a toucher.



`128 00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:44,980`
Yeah.



`129 00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,120`
You don't have to be over.



`130 00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,340`
You don't have to be creepy.



`131 00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:49,960`
No.



`132 00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,120`
Hansy.



`133 00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:51,520`
Yeah.



`134 00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,060`
But you, you, you have to,



`135 00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:58,620`
you have to understand how to be within someone's personal space



`136 00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,600`
and, and understand that you, you will have to touch them.



`137 00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:01,980`
Yeah.



`138 00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,660`
And without making them uncomfortable.



`139 00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:04,240`
Right.



`140 00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,040`
And you, you learn that through interactions.



`141 00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,980`
Like you have to be bad at something before you get good at it.



`142 00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,900`
And I've been caught.



`143 00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,680`
I am, I'm not going to tell you I'm the superhero pickpocket guy that,



`144 00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,900`
oh, I never get caught.



`145 00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,880`
It's I'm amazing.



`146 00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,920`
No, I, I, to this day, I've been doing it for 20 years.



`147 00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,920`
I still have people kind of catch me.



`148 00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,740`
They catch me on stuff, but it's a numbers game.



`149 00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,560`
It's a, it's fun.



`150 00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:34,740`
And I mean, like, um, speaking of magic and I found that, um,



`151 00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,020`
cause I've been dabbling a little bit with this sort of stuff as well.



`152 00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:41,360`
Um, I'll be happy to see you do some stuff at the bar.



`153 00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,280`
Oh, I haven't done it for years, but, but,



`154 00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,420`
but I found that because I can never get,



`155 00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,980`
get very good with like card tricks or that kind of stuff.



`156 00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,160`
Right.



`157 00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:48,420`
Okay.



`158 00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,660`
But I don't know.



`159 00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,240`
I just probably didn't have the,



`160 00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,940`
um, the focus to dedicate the energy,



`161 00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,600`
the ability to build that sort of manual dexterity.



`162 00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:55,940`
Okay.



`163 00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,340`
But, um, on the other hand,



`164 00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,300`
one of the most effective sort of tricks that I found that you could do very



`165 00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:02,760`
easily,



`166 00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,180`
especially like in a bar setting is if you prepare something and then reverse



`167 00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:07,720`
pickpocket,



`168 00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:13,560`
play something in someone's pocket and then hours later use some,



`169 00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,420`
you know,



`170 00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,460`
simple mentalism trick to whatever it is like,



`171 00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:23,000`
or make a coin disappear that you've written something on or force them to



`172 00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,720`
write,



`173 00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:23,940`
uh,



`174 00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,900`
specific sentence or something.



`175 00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,600`
And you know,



`176 00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:31,180`
you've already prepared hours ahead of time by placing that in the pocket and



`177 00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:31,660`
then,



`178 00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:31,920`
you know,



`179 00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:36,240`
making that disappear and then reappearing seemingly by magic in their pockets.



`180 00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,200`
I use,



`181 00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:37,860`
I use that,



`182 00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:38,460`
I use that,



`183 00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,300`
um,



`184 00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,160`
I've only done it a couple of times,



`185 00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:42,840`
um,



`186 00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,180`
because the circumstances were correct for it.



`187 00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,260`
But I have borrowed someone's wallet without them knowing,



`188 00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:53,220`
put something in their wallet that I have a duplicate of.



`189 00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:53,720`
Right.



`190 00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,920`
So put it back in their pocket without them knowing walk away,



`191 00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,480`
come back,



`192 00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:03,560`
do a trick that item vanished and say,



`193 00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,400`
sir,



`194 00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,800`
pull out your pocket,



`195 00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,600`
your wallet.



`196 00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,920`
And I don't say where exactly it is.



`197 00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,340`
I don't go pull the wallet out of your left pocket on the,



`198 00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,340`
on the backside of your pants.



`199 00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:15,800`
Like,



`200 00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,120`
no,



`201 00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,240`
it's just pull out your wallet and they pull out the wallet and open it up.



`202 00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,500`
What's inside.



`203 00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,040`
And they're like,



`204 00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,800`
Holy cow.



`205 00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,500`
That thing that we,



`206 00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,860`
we just saw vanished and appeared in my pocket near me.



`207 00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:27,760`
Right.



`208 00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:32,320`
And that's something that I sort of make mentioned in the talk is that it's



`209 00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,160`
not,



`210 00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,060`
um,



`211 00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:38,440`
I consider what the mythology of pickpocketing is like a crime of passion.



`212 00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,060`
You have this thing.



`213 00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,260`
I want this thing.



`214 00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,940`
I'm going to take this thing.



`215 00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:44,620`
Yeah.



`216 00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,240`
And in reality it's no,



`217 00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,560`
I I'm I'll,



`218 00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,300`
I'll hunt you.



`219 00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,060`
I'll follow you around for a while.



`220 00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:52,580`
Kind of thing.



`221 00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,120`
If I really want that thing.



`222 00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:54,920`
Yeah.



`223 00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,440`
But I'm going to do Intel first.



`224 00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,380`
I'm going to find out like,



`225 00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,220`
Oh,



`226 00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,620`
that's where he keeps it all the time.



`227 00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,600`
It only comes out when he's sitting at the table.



`228 00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:02,980`
Okay,



`229 00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:03,440`
great.



`230 00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,980`
That gives me an opportunity to make my job a little less hard until just



`231 00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:08,460`
gathering.



`232 00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:08,940`
Yes.



`233 00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:12,520`
Just like it was hacking and security and a breaching and all that kind of



`234 00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,320`
stuff.



`235 00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,020`
Like you do physical engagements.



`236 00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:15,680`
You do a,



`237 00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,180`
like a week's of reconnaissance before you actually do your engagement now with



`238 00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:20,780`
pickpocketing.



`239 00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,800`
I don't have weeks.



`240 00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,580`
I have a day.



`241 00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:27,580`
A day at most maybe an hour because the more time you're wasting on a



`242 00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:32,580`
person that's more time that could have been spent stealing something else.



`243 00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,380`
That was easier.



`244 00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:33,920`
Sure.



`245 00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,220`
Right.



`246 00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:38,220`
So if it's a specific thing for like penetration,



`247 00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,820`
physical penetration testing,



`248 00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,200`
I have more time.



`249 00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:42,980`
I have,



`250 00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,700`
you know,



`251 00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,900`
a couple hours.



`252 00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,400`
Let's see what we can do.



`253 00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:46,940`
Sure.



`254 00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,340`
Find out where they go for restaurants.



`255 00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,940`
Find out where they go for food.



`256 00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,140`
Find out where they go for restaurants.



`257 00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:52,540`
Yeah.



`258 00:08:52,540 --> 00:09:22,100`
Find out like where where do they hang out bus stops whatever whatever multiple people are at that gives me an opportunity to sort of do an intel which should only take a couple minutes I find out what you're doing right you pretty much you're on you know rinse repeat sure until the bus shows up or while you're sitting at the restaurant that at least has given me enough information to go on and like this is what I would use to do this thing yeah so



`259 00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:52,080`
that's one of the things I go into great detail at the workshop that I get asked to do is that I explain for people to get an understanding of it is a lot of people go to restaurants they'll put their cell phones on the table because they don't want it bent in their pocket if I can find a way to put something on top of said phone and then say I have to leave and pick up said thing and the phone that's still going to be a problem.



`260 00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:52,140`
Yeah.



`261 00:09:52,140 --> 00:10:22,080`
pick pocketing it's not as glamorous as me reaching in a pocket without you feeling it sure but that still happens and you're the end game is there I mean you know the end results exactly the result is the same exactly and that's all that matters yeah but it's it's still slight hand right it's still understanding direction of attention and it works under the same guys it's just our pockets are now further away from us so to speak it's like you you were explaining about.



`262 00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:51,980`
pick pocketing and a woman is usually easier because they have their stuff in a handbag or genuinely yes most women will have a purse or a handbag or of some sort and if I want to make my life super simple you know and wait for them to open up that purse like they'll pull the zipper open for them and if they're in the rush they'll leave it open yeah now I've noticed that while waiting in lines.



`263 00:10:52,100 --> 00:11:22,080`
I've seen women literally see me I'm not a small person by any means but if I'm standing beside them I've seen them literally zip a purse closed without even seeing me do anything it's just because I'm by instinct they'll zip it up because they realize that's happened but if I do my job right they don't know I'm behind them in the first place that purse is wide open there's a cell phone there's a wallet that's I look at it as the equivalent of those machines the the that drop down the whole thing.



`264 00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:50,380`
yeah pick up the stuffies yeah it's what their purse is like is whatever is whatever is loose this is coming out so it's like an amusement park yeah a little bit a little bit that's probably on the easier scale of things yes what would you say are some of the harder items harder items or locations harder locations I find honestly the back pocket back pocket and an over.



`265 00:11:52,100 --> 00:12:21,100`
fitted wallet usually in North America it's called a Costanza wallet George Costanza from the Seinfeld he pulled out his wallet it was just like big sandwich of a thing that he keeps in his back pocket and we we jokingly call people that have those kind of wallets a Costanza wallet that I can't get I wouldn't even bother trying it's just stuck in that guy's pot back pocket I'm not going to bother front pockets are actually easier especially with cell phones yeah



`266 00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:51,100`
a lot of people have cell phones and the cases that they have unless it's like an otter box which is just full on rubber sure they're still nice and smooth and they slide right out of pockets yeah cargo pockets I mean I find well in this case your cargo pockets not so much because you have this nice zipper that goes across but a lot of pockets they just have the two buttons and if you put too much stuff in a pocket the pocket sends the bow open and



`267 00:12:52,100 --> 00:13:21,980`
it's just it's like a it's like a purse for a man yeah just things pop out of that pocket because it's just open now because there you're not supposed to put a lot of stuff in those pockets that's just for convenience more than anything but people put like four or five different items in there because it's just open space that's not affecting my waist so that's what they do with it and I find that because of that weight it opens up the bottom part of the pocket so I don't even have to bother with the buttons so I'm just



`268 00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:25,100`
Så jag tog in mina två fingrar och gick och fiskade.



`269 00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,100`
Gick och fiskade?



`270 00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,100`
Ja.



`271 00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:31,100`
En annan del av din berättelse som fascinerade mig också var



`272 00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,100`
jag tror att det var bara en fråga i slutändan,



`273 00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,100`
men när du pratade om boosterbaggar.



`274 00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,100`
Hur går det att ta bort en bagg?



`275 00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:44,100`
Och för vår publik kan du kanske beskriva vad det är?



`276 00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,100`
Och är det andra verktyg i handeln?



`277 00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:52,100`
En boosterbagg är en normal bagg på utsidan.



`278 00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,100`
Den kan se ut som en doktorsbagg eller gymbagg.



`279 00:13:55,100 --> 00:14:01,100`
Men insidan är designad för att gå över en annan bagg



`280 00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:05,100`
och använda en graviditetsväg.



`281 00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:10,100`
När den styrs på den, så styrs vägen på den



`282 00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,100`
och håller den i baggen.



`283 00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,100`
Och du kan lyfta din bagg och deras bagg



`284 00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,100`
inom baggen.



`285 00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,100`
Och det ger dig möjlighet att gå med den.



`286 00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,100`
Och gå med den.



`287 00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:25,100`
Det skulle behöva lite mer intel innan.



`288 00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:29,100`
För man måste veta hur stor den är.



`289 00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,100`
Ja.



`290 00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:34,100`
Under säkerhetssäkerhet, ja.



`291 00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:38,100`
Jag skulle behöva mer intel för att få den specifika grejen.



`292 00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:42,100`
Om jag gör en penetration av fysiska ämnen och så.



`293 00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,100`
Och jag vill få den.



`294 00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,100`
Eller nåt sånt.



`295 00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,100`
Om jag har en access card som jag inte har.



`296 00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,100`
På andra hand, om du är en pickpocket och bara vill gå för något



`297 00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,100`
utan möjligheter, så...



`298 00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,100`
Jag bara behöver den ena baggen och jag tittar för allt som fitar.



`299 00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,100`
Allt som ser ut som en kniv för min hammare.



`300 00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,100`
Så...



`301 00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:04,100`
Vad är några andra verktyg som en pickpocket kan använda?



`302 00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,100`
En verktyg som jag alltid har varit fascinerad med,



`303 00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,100`
och tyvärr bor jag i ett land där switchblader är olyckliga.



`304 00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,100`
Så jag får inte ha en.



`305 00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,100`
Men det är en switchblade.



`306 00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,100`
Men vad de gör...



`307 00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:20,100`
Men det de har gjort är att de har grundat ner bladet i en öre.



`308 00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,100`
Så att bakgrunden av det...



`309 00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,100`
Den sista sidan av det börjar kurva in.



`310 00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:29,100`
Och de använder den öre för att slå öppna botten av pössar



`311 00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,100`
och bakgrunden, där walletet är.



`312 00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,100`
Så allt...



`313 00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,100`
Det är rasert.



`314 00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,100`
De måste bara ta hand om det och göra det.



`315 00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,100`
Och du kan fortfarande kolla ditt öre och tänka



`316 00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,100`
nej, min wallet är bra, han fick ingenting.



`317 00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,100`
Även om du kände det.



`318 00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,100`
Det spelar ingen roll.



`319 00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,100`
För nu, allt han ska göra är att han ska följa dig.



`320 00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,100`
Innan det faller.



`321 00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,100`
Ja, innan det faller.



`322 00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,100`
Fyra, tio minuter väntar jag.



`323 00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,100`
Om inget faller, så går jag till nästa person.



`324 00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,100`
Och någon annan kan få det.



`325 00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:01,100`
Det är så du inte måste oroa dig för skräp och sånt.



`326 00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,100`
Riktigt, ja.



`327 00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:07,100`
Men nu har jag noterat att de försöker sälja pössar som inte kan slås.



`328 00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,100`
Jag är väldigt orolig för det.



`329 00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,100`
Ja, och jag tror att...



`330 00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:15,100`
Du kanske vill förhålla dig från att skada någon.



`331 00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,100`
Det är något som jag...



`332 00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,100`
Det är vanligt.



`333 00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,100`
Det är vanligt, och det är därför du har den här övriga rörelsen.



`334 00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,100`
Och du förstår att du förstör någons pössar.



`335 00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:26,100`
Ja, och så kul som det skulle vara på scenen,



`336 00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,100`
så tror jag att många människor,



`337 00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,100`
åtminstone personen på scenen,



`338 00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,100`
skulle tro att det är lite förvånande att det hände.



`339 00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:37,100`
Jag skulle behöva ge pössar på varje performance.



`340 00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,100`
Vilket kan inte vara en dålig idé.



`341 00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,100`
Jag skulle kunna ha min bransch på pössarna.



`342 00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,100`
Ja, exakt.



`343 00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,100`
Det skulle vara bra.



`344 00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,100`
Om du stannar på den här scenen,



`345 00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,100`
så accepterar du risken för att gå hem pösslösa.



`346 00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,100`
Ingen kommer till mina program då.



`347 00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:53,100`
Jag tänkte att använda dina tekniker



`348 00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,100`
i en fysisk sammanfattning,



`349 00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:59,100`
för det finns några av de saker som du nämnde på scenen



`350 00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:05,100`
som jag direkt kan förklara som användbara tekniker



`351 00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:08,100`
när det gäller att försöka röra på någons pössar.



`352 00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,100`
Ja.



`353 00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:13,100`
Man kan röra på dem genom att distrahera dem från



`354 00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,100`
deras länjarder,



`355 00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:17,100`
och så vidare.



`356 00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:24,100`
Har du fått kontrakt för att göra fysiska sammanfattningar?



`357 00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,100`
Inte ännu.



`358 00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:30,100`
Jag vet inte om det var en grej innan denna år.



`359 00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,100`
Det var faktiskt en verklig vokation.



`360 00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,100`
Jag hittade ut det på Defcon.



`361 00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,100`
Jag höll på att lyssna på Darknet Diaries.



`362 00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:41,100`
Jag hittade ut att det var en verklig vokation,



`363 00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,100`
och jag tänkte att jag har gjort det i år.



`364 00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,100`
Du berättar att jag kan få betalt för att göra det?



`365 00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,100`
Ja.



`366 00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:50,100`
Jag har inte betalt för en konvention i 10 år.



`367 00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,100`
Det är fantastiskt.



`368 00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,100`
En annan bra skam är att röra på en podcast.



`369 00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,100`
Jag kommer att behöva titta in på det.



`370 00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,100`
Ja.



`371 00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:06,100`
Men kombinerat med lockpicking.



`372 00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,100`
Ja.



`373 00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,100`
Jag tycker att lockpicking är väldigt fascinerande.



`374 00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,100`
Jag älskar lockpicking.



`375 00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:19,100`
Det är kul hur de här intressen är så vanliga.



`376 00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:23,100`
Även om vi arbetar med computeringar varje dag.



`377 00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:27,100`
Det finns mycket överlag med folk som är intresserade av lockpicking eller pickpocketing.



`378 00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:31,100`
Och även sociala ingenjörer. Det är mycket av det du gör.



`379 00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,100`
Om jag förstår dig rätt.



`380 00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,100`
Jag måste...



`381 00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:39,100`
Vi pratade med några tjejer efter min performance.



`382 00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:44,100`
De frågade hur man kommer in i människors personliga område.



`383 00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:47,100`
Och hur jag gör det för att jag inte är du.



`384 00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:50,100`
Och jag sa att förstås är du en tjej.



`385 00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:54,100`
Så du kommer nog att kunna komma in i en mer personlig område än jag kan.



`386 00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:58,100`
Så jag måste vara mer charmig och mindre förvånande.



`387 00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,100`
För jag är en ganska stor person.



`388 00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,100`
Jag är inte så stor som vissa människor.



`389 00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,100`
Hahaha.



`390 00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,100`
Jag är en ganska stor person.



`391 00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,100`
Och jag måste förvåna mig.



`392 00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:13,100`
För att kunna komma in i människors personliga område.



`393 00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:17,100`
Och inte bli effektiv.



`394 00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,100`
Som maskotter gör för lilla barn.



`395 00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,100`
De är i de här stora skrämmande kostymerna.



`396 00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,100`
Bara vara mindre...



`397 00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,100`
Intimiderande.



`398 00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,100`
Intimiderande är nog det bästa.



`399 00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,100`
Ja.



`400 00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,100`
Och genom att göra så.



`401 00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,100`
Det ger mig möjlighet att komma in i personliga områden.



`402 00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:40,100`
Och det sociala ingenjörskonceptet ger mig möjlighet att...



`403 00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,100`
Som den dumma utländaren.



`404 00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,100`
Jag är så förvånad.



`405 00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,100`
Jag är terribel.



`406 00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,100`
Jag vet inte vad jag gör.



`407 00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,100`
Och genom att göra så.



`408 00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,100`
Jag har redan fått handen på dig.



`409 00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,100`
Det är inget stort grej.



`410 00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,100`
För det är en okej grej.



`411 00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,100`
Jag behöver hjälp.



`412 00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,100`
När du behöver hjälp.



`413 00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,100`
Du touchar någon.



`414 00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,100`
Förlåt mig.



`415 00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,100`
Ja.



`416 00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,100`
Och jag ber...



`417 00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,100`
Inte på ett litterärt sätt.



`418 00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,100`
Jag gör inte det för riktigt.



`419 00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,100`
Men du använder det för att be om folk.



`420 00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,100`
Du tar något som finns i alla.



`421 00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,100`
Och vår natur är att du vill hjälpa folk.



`422 00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,100`
Du verkligen gör det.



`423 00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,100`
Och om du kan hjälpa folk.



`424 00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,100`
Det gör att du känner dig bra.



`425 00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,100`
För du hjälper någon att stanna upp i deras liv.



`426 00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,100`
Förlåt mig.



`427 00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,100`
Det finns folk där ute som använder det.



`428 00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,100`
Och...



`429 00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,100`
Pickpocketing är en av dem.



`430 00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,100`
Ja.



`431 00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,100`
Så.



`432 00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,100`
En annan fråga som jag fick.



`433 00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,100`
Det var...



`434 00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,100`
Demonstrationer som du gav på scenen.



`435 00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,100`
Det var förstås att du stannade upp.



`436 00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,100`
Ja.



`437 00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,100`
Eller sådant.



`438 00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,100`
Men...



`439 00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,100`
Har du någonsin gjort pickpocketing?



`440 00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,100`
Sitta ner.



`441 00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,100`
Till exempel som vi ser nu.



`442 00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,100`
Det finns tekniker för...



`443 00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,100`
För...



`444 00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,100`
Att ställa saker när folk sitter.



`445 00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,100`
Det finns faktiskt en...



`446 00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,100`
Pickpocket som var väl känd för det.



`447 00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,100`
Hans namn var Mark Raffles.



`448 00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,100`
En fantastisk pickpocket.



`449 00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,100`
Jag tror att han är brittisk.



`450 00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,100`
Jag förlåter.



`451 00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,100`
Jag rör mig fortfarande inte.



`452 00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,100`
Från...



`453 00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,100`
Från att flyga här.



`454 00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:04,100`
Men Mark Raffles brukade pickpocketa sitta ner.



`455 00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,100`
Och han var bra på det.



`456 00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,100`
Han kunde...



`457 00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,100`
Den här tjejen lyfte allt och allting.



`458 00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,100`
Allt som inte var knäppt ner.



`459 00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,100`
Den tjejen skulle få.



`460 00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,100`
Och han gjorde det med två personer.



`461 00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,100`
En person satt på en sida av bordet.



`462 00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,100`
Den andra personen satt på den andra sidan av bordet.



`463 00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,100`
Och medan han stjälte saker.



`464 00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,100`
Han la saker i ditt vis.



`465 00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,100`
Han var väldigt...



`466 00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,100`
Aktivt distraherad.



`467 00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,100`
Aktivt distraherad.



`468 00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,100`
Och...



`469 00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,100`
Jag...



`470 00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,100`
Jag är lite mer lågtidig.



`471 00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,100`
Jag vet inte...



`472 00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:37,100`
Jag är säker på att det uttryckte sig väldigt bra när jag stod på scenen.



`473 00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,100`
Men jag är en stor troende av minimalistisk behov.



`474 00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,100`
Mm, ja.



`475 00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:45,100`
Om jag inte måste förlåta behov av att göra något så gör jag inte det.



`476 00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,100`
Så om jag tar något ur ditt pock.



`477 00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,100`
Jag kommer försöka gå den mest direkta vägen jag kan.



`478 00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,100`
Och...



`479 00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,100`
Det är mig som är...



`480 00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,100`
Snygg och genuint.



`481 00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,100`
Men också försöka...



`482 00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,100`
Snygg och genuint.



`483 00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:02,100`
Men också försöka göra så att du ska göra vad jag vill.



`484 00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,100`
Det låter bra.



`485 00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,100`
Ja.



`486 00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,100`
Jag måste vara i behov.



`487 00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,100`
Jag menar...



`488 00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,100`
Det är bara...



`489 00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,100`
Inte bara...



`490 00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,100`
Det hjälper inte min OCD.



`491 00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,100`
Men...



`492 00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,100`
Men ändå...



`493 00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,100`
Att ha din mark att tro att de är i behov.



`494 00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,100`
Ja.



`495 00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,100`
Det är...



`496 00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,100`
Det är viktig.



`497 00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,100`
Ja.



`498 00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,100`
Om du...



`499 00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,100`
Om någon...



`500 00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,100`
Känner att de är i behov.



`501 00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,100`
Ja.



`502 00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,100`
De är mycket mer relaxerade.



`503 00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,100`
Ja.



`504 00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,100`
Självklart.



`505 00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,100`
Eftersom de känner att det finns ingenting...



`506 00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,100`
Den här personen...



`507 00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,100`
Ja.



`508 00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,100`
Som kan göra något.



`509 00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,100`
För jag är i behov.



`510 00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,100`
Ja.



`511 00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,100`
Jag är i kontroll av situationen.



`512 00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,100`
Så du lämnar dina rörelser.



`513 00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,100`
Och du...



`514 00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,100`
Jag älskar att säga det så.



`515 00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,100`
Jag måste komma upp med ett bättre ord.



`516 00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,100`
För att säga rörelser är som...



`517 00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,100`
I stället för att jag har en kniv.



`518 00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,100`
Jag har bara en spork.



`519 00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,100`
Du vet.



`520 00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,100`
Som...



`521 00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,100`
Jag tror att jag behöver ett bättre ord än rörelser.



`522 00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,100`
Ja.



`523 00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,100`
Vi lär oss något.



`524 00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,100`
Okej.



`525 00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,100`
Riktigt.



`526 00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,100`
Fint.



`527 00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,100`
Men...



`528 00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,100`
Men...



`529 00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,100`
Ja.



`530 00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,100`
Det är bara det...



`531 00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,100`
Det är ett bra ord för det.



`532 00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,100`
Du...



`533 00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,100`
Du...



`534 00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,100`
Du...



`535 00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,100`
Du...



`536 00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,100`
Du...



`537 00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,100`
Du...



`538 00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,100`
Det är bara din machtpåväg.



`539 00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,100`
Ja, visst.



`540 00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,100`
Om jag kan lägga ner det...



`541 00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,500`
Och du är...



`542 00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:07,300`
Du är längre på röd indel 전에, så får jag en större möjlighet att...



`543 00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,380`
Att betala saker.



`544 00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,500`
Idag, med och för att...



`545 00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,620`
Om jag kommer ut så aggressiv och allt.



`546 00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,620`
Men...



`547 00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:14,620`
Men...



`548 00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,620`
Det...



`549 00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,620`
хочется ändras.



`550 00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,620`
Jag...



`551 00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,620`
Jag...



`552 00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,640`
Fattar att jag måste vara aggressiv mot vissa människor.



`553 00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,320`
För den är därom de slutar att ge mig jobboxen.



`554 00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,800`
Men jag anför att folk...



`555 00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,400`
Att närma sig annorlunda ansvar.



`556 00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,060`
Ja...



`557 00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,960`
Not everyone is the same, but that being said



`558 00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,980`
we're not all unique snowflakes.



`559 00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,960`
I mean, that was



`560 00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,760`
one of the



`561 00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,000`
things that you



`562 00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,300`
got asked the question



`563 00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:41,140`
and I believe



`564 00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,280`
your reply was something like



`565 00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,760`
I would be very aggressive or



`566 00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,860`
something like...



`567 00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:48,540`
If I have to be, yes.



`568 00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,060`
And that wouldn't look nice on stage, of course.



`569 00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:51,660`
No, it's...



`570 00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,560`
I'm entertained.



`571 00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,220`
I don't want to do that.



`572 00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,700`
I can't believe you're doing this.



`573 00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,220`
I don't want to do that on stage because that's



`574 00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,220`
not what is...



`575 00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,240`
It'll be entertaining for some.



`576 00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,080`
Won't be entertaining for all



`577 00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,440`
and it certainly won't be entertaining for the nice person



`578 00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,560`
that decided to come up.



`579 00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,480`
And as you saw in the talk



`580 00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,440`
I asked the gentleman in the front



`581 00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,220`
and he...



`582 00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,120`
His face went white.



`583 00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,360`
I'm going to be embarrassed



`584 00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,640`
in front of all these people.



`585 00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,280`
That's what his immediate reaction was and I'm like, okay



`586 00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,160`
we're going to let this bounce



`587 00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,260`
off him to the other guy because the other guy behind him



`588 00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,320`
was like, me?



`589 00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:32,080`
And I'm like, perfect, yes.



`590 00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,300`
You. Let's get you



`591 00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,980`
up here. But the other guy, honestly



`592 00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:38,300`
I scoped him out. He had a cell phone.



`593 00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,720`
He had a wallet. He had a watch.



`594 00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:42,340`
I think he had a couple other items. I would have been able to borrow



`595 00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,000`
more things on stage.



`596 00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,520`
But I took



`597 00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,280`
who I could get because I don't want to have...



`598 00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,080`
I don't want to get manhandly



`599 00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,320`
if that's a word.



`600 00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,280`
We'll make it one.



`601 00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,860`
I've seen



`602 00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,980`
older pickpockets, at least theatrical



`603 00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,020`
pickpockets where they're very aggressive



`604 00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,400`
and moving the person.



`605 00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,400`
I'm not a huge fan of that.



`606 00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,160`
I find that that allows



`607 00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,160`
them to remember the moment



`608 00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,160`
it happened more later



`609 00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,400`
on. If they can



`610 00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,000`
pinpoint, oh, this



`611 00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,160`
is when it happened. He was pushing



`612 00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,120`
me and moving me



`613 00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,040`
around and all the rest of that stuff.



`614 00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,780`
That's when they can trace it back.



`615 00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,600`
But if you can be a little more



`616 00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,700`
gentle,



`617 00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,140`
I guess is the right word, or



`618 00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:30,120`
less aggressive, I guess



`619 00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,180`
would be a better word. I still have to be in charge.



`620 00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,040`
I still have to put you



`621 00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:34,780`
in the right position.



`622 00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,780`
Not in a way that you might remember specifically.



`623 00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,100`
Exactly. If you can pinpoint



`624 00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,040`
certain spots, then you can go back and go



`625 00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,300`
that's when he did it.



`626 00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,880`
Sorry, we got a bit lucky there that



`627 00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,340`
Dan was in the front



`628 00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,120`
row, right?



`629 00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,480`
Dan was chomping



`630 00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,280`
on the bit to come up, and I'm happy



`631 00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,140`
he was because it made my life easier.



`632 00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:55,800`
I don't know where...



`633 00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:56,900`
Anders went.



`634 00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,740`
He was supposed to come up because he had the jacket, and I can



`635 00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,700`
work all the stuff, and then he showed up halfway through



`636 00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,660`
the show, and I'm like, well, it's too late now. I've already got



`637 00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,820`
Dan up here. But thankfully, Dan was a great sport



`638 00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,400`
to come up and do that.



`639 00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,400`
How he'd work with the carabiner as well.



`640 00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,520`
Yeah, and those...



`641 00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,440`
His was a unique one.



`642 00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:14,800`
The lock ones.



`643 00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,620`
The only reason I used him is because



`644 00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,340`
he had one, but



`645 00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,660`
I wouldn't go after his because he has that



`646 00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,940`
weird twist locky thing.



`647 00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,820`
But in actual sense,



`648 00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,440`
if Dan is...



`649 00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,740`
is busy doing something, I can



`650 00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,120`
take my time and actually



`651 00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,520`
twist it and open it and everything.



`652 00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,740`
I imagine if you know that you're going after that



`653 00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,420`
sort of item, then...



`654 00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,800`
Then you would take the time to practice to do it.



`655 00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,120`
Learn how to do it with probably one hand.



`656 00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,660`
Is that the big secret of magic?



`657 00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,680`
The amount of time it takes to learn?



`658 00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,840`
They're fairly easy. I mean, I've been



`659 00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,460`
doing some mountain climbing, and



`660 00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:50,000`
it's fairly easy to operate with one hand.



`661 00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,020`
They're made for being operated



`662 00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:52,620`
with one hand.



`663 00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,540`
They have to be, because the other hand is working with something.



`664 00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:56,140`
I'm probably holding on to something.



`665 00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:00,000`
Yeah, so, and they are safe.



`666 00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,300`
They will never fall off deliberately,



`667 00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:06,460`
but they do make it way easier for a person like myself



`668 00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:10,040`
to just pinch and turn, and it's off.



`669 00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:14,120`
It's easy to go, and it's the same with lanyards.



`670 00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,720`
A lot of lanyards tend to have that nice little pinch.



`671 00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:17,720`
Yeah.



`672 00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,780`
Not so much the ones that they have here at this conference



`673 00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,540`
where you have to pull a lever and open it.



`674 00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,240`
They usually have a little...



`675 00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:27,420`
Tension spring, where you just squeeze it.



`676 00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:30,080`
And if you can get close enough to squeeze that,



`677 00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,880`
it's just a quick lift and off.



`678 00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:32,180`
Yeah.



`679 00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,720`
And it's fun, because a lot of people are like,



`680 00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,780`
oh, can you get one of these off?



`681 00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,780`
And I'm like, yeah, but not right now.



`682 00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,120`
Not right now, because you deliberately came up and asked me.



`683 00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,960`
You're going to see everything now.



`684 00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:46,280`
Yeah.



`685 00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,780`
But it's an opportunistic skill.



`686 00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:53,580`
My friend in England, his name is James Brown.



`687 00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,420`
He put out a book called...



`688 00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:57,540`
He calls himself the opportunist.



`689 00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,780`
I think you put out a number of albums as well.



`690 00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,380`
Yes, that's the funny thing.



`691 00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:07,860`
But he is a pickpocket and hypnotist in England,



`692 00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:11,540`
which I think is really the real reason he's able to get away with pickpocketing,



`693 00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:14,660`
is he just hypnotizes them ahead of time and steals stuff.



`694 00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:19,540`
But he uses that kind of stuff where it's just...



`695 00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,560`
He's brilliant at it.



`696 00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,560`
And he works with...



`697 00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,380`
Fun little stuff like that.



`698 00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:29,300`
All right, man.



`699 00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,420`
Thank you so much for sitting down with us.



`700 00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,200`
Thank you, guys.



`701 00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,060`
Thank you for inviting me out here



`702 00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:39,780`
and getting to chat about something that I don't get that often to chat about.



`703 00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,540`
So, thank you.



`704 00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,480`
I'm sure there'll be people buying you drinks at the bar all night long.



`705 00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:43,820`
Perfect.



`706 00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,000`
Trying to steal your stuff.



`707 00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,920`
Thankfully, I got those dummy ones ready to go.



`708 00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,720`
So, I'm ready.



`709 00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:51,300`
Cool.



`710 00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,380`
Awesome. Thank you, Jay.



`711 00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:52,520`
Later.



`712 00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:52,900`
Sorry.



`713 00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,540`
Tack.
