`1 00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000`
Hej och välkommen till Säkerhetspodcasten som idag spelar in från Securityfest på Eriksbergshallen i Göteborg.



`2 00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:22,080`
Vi har lyssnat på ett antal spännande framträden här och just nu så har jag med mig en av talarna, Dave Lewis från Akamai.



`3 00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,160`
Välkommen Dave.



`4 00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,120`
Tack för att jag har med mig.



`5 00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:30,400`
Jag vill först tacka dig för en fantastisk presentation. Jag tror att det var väldigt bra.



`6 00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:40,100`
Du visste ett par vissnader som jag tror att många människor borde lyssna på och ta till deras hjärta.



`7 00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:48,400`
Bara för vårt publik som inte är här idag, kan du bara kort säga vad du pratade om?



`8 00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,240`
Ja, säkert.



`9 00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,820`
En av sakerna som jag har försökt göra är att jag har gått igenom och plockat data breach.



`10 00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,040`
Publicity.



`11 00:00:54,120 --> 00:01:00,160`
Public disclosures for 2016 and started going through them trying to look for commonalities, root causes, things like that.



`12 00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:08,940`
And the one overarching problem that I saw was really related back to patch management issues or the lack of patches being applied in many cases.



`13 00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:14,640`
So I tried to set it up where I was going to do, oh, you know, this is the percentage of this, this is the percentage of that.



`14 00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:22,580`
And the way the data was reported or the information was presented was such a way that it was so much heavy lifting that actually the talk turned into a narrative.



`15 00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:28,320`
And I discovered that when I'm extremely jet lagged, the talk goes a little faster than I anticipated.



`16 00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:39,500`
The problem really does boil down to very old problems, as one person mentioned during questions, that these are a lot of these problems are old problems that we've known about for a long time, but that's just it.



`17 00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,980`
We tend to have this bad habit of ignoring the old problems in face of the new shiny things that pop up.



`18 00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:51,260`
Yes. I mean, I think this applies to all industries.



`19 00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:52,220`
Yes.



`20 00:01:52,580 --> 00:02:05,280`
And when you look at systems with cobwebs all over them, I mean, that exists in all sectors.



`21 00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:18,640`
And like you said, we're as security professionals, we can work in almost any sector because we have a skill set that's applicable basically in all industries.



`22 00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:19,660`
Yeah, absolutely.



`23 00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,280`
And the one thing that we have to do collectively as security professionals.



`24 00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:27,340`
A better job of that is, is understanding the organization you're working for.



`25 00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:27,780`
Yes.



`26 00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,920`
So the risks will change from one organization to the next.



`27 00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:42,740`
So what would be a vulnerability on a system for this particular organization may have absolutely nothing to do with another company who has that particular system segregated off in a zone that can't be reached.



`28 00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:43,400`
Yeah, yeah.



`29 00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:51,920`
So in your experience, when you look at these...



`30 00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:58,960`
\...security breaches, what would you say was the common denominator?



`31 00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:10,140`
Is it poor management or would you say it's lack of understanding or is it simply lack of processes?



`32 00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:17,860`
So the lack of processes I can't really speak to because that would be an organizational thing that each organization will do differently.



`33 00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:22,420`
From an external view, it appears to be a patch management issue.



`34 00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:30,320`
Because a lot of the times of the breaches that were discussed really could track back to a missing patch or something as simple as a configuration issue.



`35 00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:39,980`
For example, there was one, a defense contractor, just in the last 24 hours, it was discovered that he had posted all sorts of intelligence data on a publicly available AMI.



`36 00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:44,120`
So from a process perspective, that should never happen.



`37 00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,300`
And I'm willing to bet that organization is very clear that that shouldn't have happened.



`38 00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,460`
So I think that was an outlier.



`39 00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,020`
But that's one of those problems.



`40 00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:57,180`
We have to be ever vigilant because these mistakes will happen as well as patches will get missed.



`41 00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,200`
We look at the WannaCry stuff.



`42 00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:04,680`
Granted, the patch came out in March, but SMB version 1 could have been turned off a long, long time ago.



`43 00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:11,860`
You also said something that's important.



`44 00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:19,340`
And it's an important lesson, I think, for people working within this space of security.



`45 00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,340`
And that is being able to...



`46 00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:26,780`
To speak in a language that management understands.



`47 00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,140`
And that is putting it down in monetary terms.



`48 00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:34,300`
Okay, how much should we evaluate this risk to?



`49 00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:41,580`
And what could be the possible implications if this was exploited?



`50 00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,200`
And that's just it.



`51 00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,520`
We have to be able to speak to them in a language they'll understand.



`52 00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,340`
If we go in there literally with our hair on fire saying, vulnerability to this will pop a shell on...



`53 00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,720`
They don't understand that.



`54 00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,140`
And that's not their job to understand that.



`55 00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,600`
They understand risk.



`56 00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:01,320`
And if you can put terms in such a way they can understand as to what the risk is to the environment,



`57 00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:05,880`
how much it'll cost, what will be the damage if this in fact came to pass.



`58 00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,480`
That's stuff they can understand.



`59 00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,760`
That's stuff they can action on.



`60 00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,800`
And that's where you end up actually getting your budget.



`61 00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:15,740`
Not from running with your hair on fire, but giving a clear, concise business case as to how the risk is going to be managed.



`62 00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:21,860`
And I think it's probably one of those areas where we...



`63 00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,440`
We see a lot of...



`64 00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:32,700`
There is a gap between what security people like to do and what they are good at.



`65 00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:39,540`
And what security people should do in order to actually make a difference.



`66 00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:47,180`
And that is, I mean, personally I'm working in the management team where I am right now.



`67 00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,720`
So I mean, I need to use their language all the time.



`68 00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:52,740`
So it's...



`69 00:05:52,740 --> 00:06:04,620`
But I think a lot of people, they like to get around and do pen tests and find the vulnerabilities in the system



`70 00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,600`
and get all carried away with that.



`71 00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:11,540`
But we need to get good at talking to management as well.



`72 00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:15,180`
Yeah, and I'm absolutely guilty of the aforementioned.



`73 00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,340`
For example, I was at the Hack in the Box conference just recently.



`74 00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,000`
I was listening to a talk and I was thinking about it.



`75 00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,800`
And then all of a sudden I spun up my laptop and I was reversing Android apps because,



`76 00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,800`
well, it seemed like the thing to do at the time.



`77 00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,340`
And it's one of those things where we literally will go,



`78 00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,340`
ooh, shiny, and chase the rabbit down the hole.



`79 00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,340`
But you're absolutely right.



`80 00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,340`
While it's fun to do that sort of thing,



`81 00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:42,340`
like when you're doing a pen test and you're able to gain access to a system that really you shouldn't have been able to gain access to,



`82 00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,340`
there is a level...



`83 00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,340`
Exactly. There's a level of euphoria there.



`84 00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,340`
And it's a rush.



`85 00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,340`
And you kind of get addicted to the rush.



`86 00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:50,840`
Yeah.



`87 00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,840`
But on the same time,



`88 00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,840`
we have to be the adults in the room



`89 00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,840`
and be able to actually clearly articulate



`90 00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,840`
what the risk is to the organization.



`91 00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,840`
And that's, you know,



`92 00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,840`
when I worked as a consultant,



`93 00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,840`
that was the boring part,



`94 00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,840`
like trying to quantify the risk



`95 00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,840`
and, you know,



`96 00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,840`
creating a good report.



`97 00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,840`
That took probably almost



`98 00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,840`
as much time as



`99 00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,840`
the actual security review.



`100 00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,840`
But that was



`101 00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,840`
the business value



`102 00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,840`
for the customer, that was that report.



`103 00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,840`
Exactly.



`104 00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,840`
If they don't have that report in hand,



`105 00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,840`
they can't in turn use that to build their business case



`106 00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,840`
to improve things for themselves.



`107 00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,840`
So yeah, granted, it's boring.



`108 00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,840`
I never enjoyed report writing.



`109 00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,840`
I'd freely admit that.



`110 00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,840`
But I also understood, later on,



`111 00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,840`
I also understood that it was an essential work product.



`112 00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,840`
Organizations do live on those essential work products.



`113 00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,840`
Great.



`114 00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,840`
So have you listened to any of the other talks



`115 00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,840`
for the conference?



`116 00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,840`
Regrettably not yet.



`117 00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,840`
Jetlag got the better of me,



`118 00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,840`
so I only showed up just at the tail end



`119 00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,840`
of Franz Talk,



`120 00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,840`
but I will be catching the rest of them



`121 00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,840`
for the rest of the day.



`122 00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,840`
Unfortunately, when you have two crying babies



`123 00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,840`
on a transatlantic flight next to you,



`124 00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,840`
it doesn't work out so well.



`125 00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,840`
It's been a good conference



`126 00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,840`
and I'm very much looking forward



`127 00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,840`
to the finishing part now



`128 00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,840`
with the lightning talks.



`129 00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,840`
So thank you Dave for taking some time



`130 00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,840`
to talk to us and talk to our listeners.



`131 00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,840`
Thank you. Talk. Thanks.



`132 00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,840`
Hej och välkommen till Säkerhetspodcasten



`133 00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,840`
Hej och välkommen till Säkerhetspodcasten



`134 00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,840`
Hej och välkommen till Säkerhetspodcasten



`135 00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,840`
som idag spelar in ifrån Securityfest



`136 00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,840`
som idag spelar in ifrån Securityfest



`137 00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,840`
i Göteborg, där vi pratar lite



`138 00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,840`
med några av talarna.



`139 00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,840`
Och nu har jag med mig Steve Lord



`140 00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,840`
och nu har jag med mig Steve Lord



`141 00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,840`
som höll dagens keynote.



`142 00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,840`
Welcome Steve.



`143 00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,840`
Thanks.



`144 00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,840`
Thanks for taking some time to talk to us



`145 00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,840`
and talk a little bit about



`146 00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,840`
what you were



`147 00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,840`
presenting today in your keynote.



`148 00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,840`
First of all



`149 00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,840`
to introduce you



`150 00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,840`
to our listeners. Could you tell us a little bit



`151 00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,840`
about yourself and your



`152 00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,840`
engagement



`153 00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,840`
in the community and



`154 00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,840`
around 44Con and so on.



`155 00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,840`
So I co-founded



`156 00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,840`
44Con back in 2011.



`157 00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,840`
By day I pen test



`158 00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,840`
and have been doing so for nearly 20 years



`159 00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,840`
and spend quite a lot of time breaking



`160 00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,840`
IoT devices.



`161 00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,840`
I started to know



`162 00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,840`
that I enjoyed breaking stuff



`163 00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,840`
a lot less than building things securely.



`164 00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,840`
So I started working on things to try



`165 00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,840`
and improve the state of IoT security



`166 00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,840`
and in the process failed



`167 00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,840`
spectacularly.



`168 00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,840`
There simply



`169 00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,840`
wasn't demand for it at the time.



`170 00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,840`
So I kind of



`171 00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,840`
pen tested stuff and I



`172 00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,840`
helped run 44Con, which is a



`173 00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,840`
conference in London. We have about 500



`174 00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,840`
people a year. Unfortunately



`175 00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,840`
it clashes with a conference here in Sweden.



`176 00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,840`
But there's not a lot we can do about that.



`177 00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,840`
No, no.



`178 00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,840`
I've been to 44Con and it's



`179 00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,840`
a really, really, really good conference.



`180 00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,840`
And I like the



`181 00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,840`
concept and



`182 00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,840`
although I didn't find the hidden track though.



`183 00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,840`
Maybe I asked the wrong



`184 00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,840`
people.



`185 00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,840`
But I enjoyed it and it was



`186 00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,840`
a good conference



`187 00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,840`
because you



`188 00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,840`
got a good community feel and you



`189 00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,840`
were close to the speakers.



`190 00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,840`
That's good.



`191 00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,840`
And



`192 00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,840`
the same sort of thing is



`193 00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,840`
what I like about Securityfest



`194 00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,840`
and SecT and the



`195 00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,840`
smaller conferences.



`196 00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,840`
Going to



`197 00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,840`
larger cons in Vegas



`198 00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,840`
is just



`199 00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,840`
people.



`200 00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,840`
Yeah, at some point it kind of turns into an exhibition



`201 00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,840`
really, doesn't it?



`202 00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,840`
I really would like to go to SecT one year.



`203 00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,840`
But certainly Securityfest



`204 00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,840`
has been a really amazing event so far.



`205 00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,840`
Great to hear.



`206 00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,840`
Well, you delivered today's



`207 00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,840`
keynote and



`208 00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,840`
a lot of insights and



`209 00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,840`
observations around



`210 00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,840`
the state



`211 00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,840`
of IoT and where it's going



`212 00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,840`
and where we are in the



`213 00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,840`
Gartner hype cycle.



`214 00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,840`
Could you give us a very, very



`215 00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,840`
short summary of what you were



`216 00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,840`
talking about today for our listeners?



`217 00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,840`
Sure, so the main



`218 00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,840`
takeaways I guess are that IoT



`219 00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,840`
is much like any other type of technology



`220 00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,840`
that comes along. From a security perspective



`221 00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,840`
we have to understand the



`222 00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,840`
problem space, understand the solution



`223 00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,840`
space. We then have



`224 00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,840`
to iterate over



`225 00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,840`
point solutions to point problems



`226 00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,840`
and then as the technology matures



`227 00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,840`
we then consolidate



`228 00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,840`
those point solutions into frameworks



`229 00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,840`
into guidances,



`230 00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,840`
guidance standards and where needed



`231 00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,840`
regulatory requirements.



`232 00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,840`
Looking at those



`233 00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,840`
graphs that you were



`234 00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,840`
showing them, the maturity level



`235 00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,840`
and the hype cycle and so on.



`236 00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,840`
I was



`237 00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,840`
doing one



`238 00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,840`
sort of observation



`239 00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,840`
or reflection that



`240 00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,840`
it doesn't necessarily need



`241 00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,840`
to correlate because if you look at



`242 00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,840`
another



`243 00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,840`
sort of IoT related area



`244 00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,840`
and industrial



`245 00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,840`
control systems which is a very



`246 00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,840`
mature



`247 00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,840`
market but



`248 00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,840`
they haven't been exposed to



`249 00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,840`
security scrutiny for many years



`250 00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,840`
so they're



`251 00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,840`
very early on in their



`252 00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,840`
adoption rate when it comes to



`253 00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,840`
security features and



`254 00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,840`
building secure systems.



`255 00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,840`
I think you can actually treat



`256 00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,840`
the control system stuff as a



`257 00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,840`
separate technology in the sense that



`258 00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,840`
there is the classical control system



`259 00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,840`
where the main



`260 00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,840`
security feature was we're not connecting



`261 00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,840`
this to the internet so it's all good



`262 00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,840`
and then the modern control system



`263 00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,840`
which main



`264 00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,840`
product feature is that we're



`265 00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,840`
connecting this to the internet.



`266 00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,840`
If you treat them as two separate technologies you



`267 00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,840`
identify that the connected stuff is



`268 00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,840`
very immature from a security



`269 00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,840`
perspective whereas the



`270 00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,840`
classical setup is



`271 00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,840`
mature from a security



`272 00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,840`
perspective because the security requirements



`273 00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,840`
are understood and the security issues



`274 00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,840`
are understood. What we have is a branch



`275 00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,840`
off where in the modern control



`276 00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,840`
systems environment we no longer understand



`277 00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,840`
that problem space.



`278 00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,840`
If we don't understand the problem space we can't develop



`279 00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,840`
solutions for the problems.



`280 00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,840`
Right, and also if you have



`281 00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,840`
a situation where



`282 00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,840`
you rely on



`283 00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,840`
communication technology



`284 00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,840`
that sort of abstracts



`285 00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,840`
the layers of



`286 00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,840`
communication



`287 00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,840`
a lot of that is lost



`288 00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,840`
on the



`289 00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,840`
consumer or the companies



`290 00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,840`
buying control systems or installing



`291 00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,840`
control systems. They don't understand that they



`292 00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,840`
are exposing their



`293 00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,840`
systems



`294 00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,840`
to a level of risk



`295 00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,840`
because they don't understand



`296 00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,840`
the communication protocols



`297 00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,840`
that they are introducing.



`298 00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,840`
Indeed in some cases



`299 00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,840`
if you take for example a car manufacturer



`300 00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,840`
that has a



`301 00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,840`
production line



`302 00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,840`
with machines. When it's not connected



`303 00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,840`
to the network these machines



`304 00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,840`
individually perform individual tasks



`305 00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,840`
on the production line. But when it's



`306 00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,840`
connected really all that happens is



`307 00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,840`
that they become joined up into a



`308 00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,840`
single mega machine.



`309 00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,840`
And if that's not properly managed



`310 00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,840`
both at the protocol level and at the



`311 00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,840`
business logic level then things can go wrong.



`312 00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,840`
And unless somebody fully understands



`313 00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,840`
how it's all put together, things will go wrong.



`314 00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,840`
Yeah.



`315 00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,840`
Definitely.



`316 00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,840`
Now speaking of IoT



`317 00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,840`
you're also



`318 00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,840`
one of the persons



`319 00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,840`
behind the



`320 00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,840`
badge for



`321 00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,840`
this conference. Could you tell us a little bit



`322 00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,840`
about what we're walking around



`323 00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,840`
wearing around our necks? Sure.



`324 00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,840`
So about a year and a half ago



`325 00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,840`
my



`326 00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,840`
so



`327 00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,840`
some time ago my grandmother



`328 00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,840`
became quite ill and



`329 00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,840`
she was getting on quite a bit



`330 00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,840`
and we found that she was



`331 00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,840`
talking about her past a lot more than the future



`332 00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,840`
and when I went to see her because she was feeling quite depressed



`333 00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,840`
about things she



`334 00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,840`
would feel very down and



`335 00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,840`
we would struggle to find things to talk about



`336 00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,840`
to bring her out of that sort of stuff.



`337 00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,840`
So I started by doing some science



`338 00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,840`
experiments with electronics and trying to get



`339 00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,840`
her involved so it would give us things to talk about.



`340 00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,840`
One of the things that I was working on at the time



`341 00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,840`
was a board to do



`342 00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,840`
to play around with the



`343 00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,840`
USB hidden interface to do some research around there.



`344 00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,840`
So I started getting her involved



`345 00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,840`
in some of that



`346 00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,840`
and just having something



`347 00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,840`
to talk about with her. And then later on



`348 00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,840`
that kind of developed into what we've got now



`349 00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,840`
which is a thing called the HIDIOT which stands for the



`350 00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,840`
Human Interface Device Input



`351 00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,840`
Output Toolkit. So basically



`352 00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,840`
it's a board that



`353 00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,840`
you build yourself. It's like a scaled down



`354 00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,840`
Arduino and



`355 00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,840`
this is a little tiny



`356 00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,840`
computer that you build from the component up where



`357 00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,840`
you're able to understand everything that it does.



`358 00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,840`
Everything at the



`359 00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,840`
hardware level, everything at the software level.



`360 00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,840`
So you program it with the Arduino IDE



`361 00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,840`
there's a bunch of tutorials



`362 00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,840`
and projects over at



`363 00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,840`
docs.hidiot.com that



`364 00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,840`
take you from what is this electricity



`365 00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,840`
thing and how does it work through to



`366 00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,840`
let's go and build a bunch of different projects



`367 00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,840`
that do different things and explore different



`368 00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,840`
aspects of interaction with



`369 00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,840`
humans and hardware. Cool.



`370 00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,840`
So the target audience



`371 00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,840`
is that for educational



`372 00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,840`
purposes or is it



`373 00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,840`
something else? It's a



`374 00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,840`
combination of the educational and hobbyist



`375 00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,840`
market. So we're



`376 00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,840`
looking at it from the point of view of 11



`377 00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,840`
to 16 year olds from



`378 00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,840`
the idea that if we pitch



`379 00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,840`
the reading



`380 00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,840`
level and the comprehension level



`381 00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,840`
at the 11 to 16 year old range



`382 00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,840`
then the rest of us who are a little bit



`383 00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,840`
older should be able to understand it.



`384 00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,840`
Hopefully.



`385 00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,840`
The idea is to make it so that we focus on the



`386 00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,840`
electronics and programming so that



`387 00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,840`
the English itself is not a barrier.



`388 00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,840`
Originally we looked at having 7 year olds



`389 00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,840`
do it but it turns out that while 7 year olds



`390 00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,840`
can solder, parents are



`391 00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,840`
incredibly uncomfortable with their 7 year old



`392 00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,840`
children holding 200 degree



`393 00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,840`
solder irons.



`394 00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,840`
I'm



`395 00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,840`
looking forward to trying this at home. I have



`396 00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,840`
a 10 year old and a 12 year old



`397 00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,840`
so I'll have them



`398 00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,840`
assemble this and see how it goes.



`399 00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,840`
I'll let you know.



`400 00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,840`
Alright.



`401 00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,840`
Now



`402 00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,840`
this conference has



`403 00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,840`
sort of been targeted



`404 00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,840`
towards internet of things



`405 00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,840`
and



`406 00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,840`
embedded devices and so on.



`407 00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,840`
Have you listened to



`408 00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,840`
any of the other speakers?



`409 00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,840`
Yeah, I found Aaron Guzman's talk



`410 00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,840`
was quite enlightening.



`411 00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,840`
Especially as in my talk I referenced



`412 00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,840`
Belkin Wemo and he'd spent some time at Belkin



`413 00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,840`
working on Wemo. I think in terms



`414 00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,840`
of a product



`415 00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,840`
that's probably the best example of a mature



`416 00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,840`
IoT device that's been through the pain.



`417 00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,840`
Because Belkin



`418 00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,840`
bless their cotton socks,



`419 00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,840`
traditionally they make routers and they make



`420 00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,840`
switches. And it's just like



`421 00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,840`
we mentioned with the control systems



`422 00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,840`
you connect these things to



`423 00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,840`
the internet and magical things that you never



`424 00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,840`
considered start to happen, some of which are not



`425 00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,840`
exactly good. And with



`426 00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,840`
Wemo they've really worked really



`427 00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,840`
hard over time and they've made



`428 00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,840`
mistakes which Aaron spoke



`429 00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,840`
about. And they've



`430 00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,840`
recovered from those mistakes as well.



`431 00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,840`
And I think that they're a really good example



`432 00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,840`
of how you can go from



`433 00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,840`
having a product that has not



`434 00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,840`
had a security work stream embedded in the start



`435 00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,840`
and get to a point where you have



`436 00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,840`
a reasonable security



`437 00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,840`
program. There will always be flaws



`438 00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,840`
that will be found but



`439 00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,840`
they have a way of handling the issues



`440 00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,840`
that arise that's reasonably mature.



`441 00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,840`
I think the only real thing that we could ask for more



`442 00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,840`
from Belkin and Wemo is



`443 00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,840`
that perhaps they publish more



`444 00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,840`
about their security experiences.



`445 00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,840`
Aaron was



`446 00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,840`
pointing out



`447 00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,840`
the supply chain of



`448 00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,840`
IoT as one of the major problems.



`449 00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,840`
Would you



`450 00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,840`
agree with that picture?



`451 00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,840`
Pretty much



`452 00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,840`
100%.



`453 00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,840`
It's



`454 00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,840`
a really tough



`455 00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,840`
one because



`456 00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,840`
so many of the ODMs



`457 00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,840`
they have their own



`458 00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,840`
SDKs that are usually built on



`459 00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,840`
open source software but require you to



`460 00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,840`
sign fairly regressive NDAs



`461 00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,840`
to start working with them.



`462 00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,840`
And so



`463 00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,840`
you end up committing to spending a huge amount



`464 00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,840`
of money on a platform



`465 00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,840`
that you then open up and



`466 00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,840`
you get your SDK and you're like this is GCC



`467 00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,840`
it's a really old GCC



`468 00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,840`
there's an old glibc



`469 00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,840`
I'm stuck on this particular Linux kernel



`470 00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,840`
version for the lifetime of this product.



`471 00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,840`
And there is



`472 00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,840`
things that you just can't upgrade.



`473 00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,840`
It's a really



`474 00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,840`
really frustrating process.



`475 00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,840`
And then at the other end of the scale you have



`476 00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,840`
things like at the moment I'm playing



`477 00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,840`
with a Mediatek



`478 00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,840`
system on chip mobile phone



`479 00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,840`
that I'm pulling apart for fun.



`480 00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,840`
And my goal is to try and



`481 00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,840`
port Linux to it.



`482 00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,840`
It's a non-featured phone but it's got an



`483 00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,840`
ARM chip that should be capable.



`484 00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,840`
And basically



`485 00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,840`
there's no



`486 00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,840`
NDA because it's



`487 00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,840`
not really, it doesn't feel very legit



`488 00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,840`
when you look at this thing.



`489 00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,840`
And I can imagine



`490 00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,840`
that for people looking



`491 00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,840`
to build IoT when you're engaging at that level



`492 00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,840`
it's really annoying. But that's why things like



`493 00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,840`
Electric Imp and Particle



`494 00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,840`
and to some extent SAP's



`495 00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,840`
Internet of Things cloud and Bluemix



`496 00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,840`
stuff like that starts to come into play



`497 00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,840`
and it makes things so much easier by



`498 00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,840`
having patterns that you know work



`499 00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,840`
and taking some of that and abstracting it away



`500 00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,840`
from you.



`501 00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,840`
Cool.



`502 00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,840`
So before we end



`503 00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,840`
the interview I'd like to thank you for



`504 00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,840`
a good keynote today



`505 00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,840`
and thank you for taking



`506 00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,840`
some time with us and



`507 00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,840`
sharing with our listeners.



`508 00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,840`
And I'd like



`509 00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,840`
to give you a few



`510 00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,840`
minutes to pitch why



`511 00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,840`
our listeners should go to



`512 00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,840`
London and



`513 00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,840`
44Con.



`514 00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,840`
Aside from the wondrous climate?



`515 00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,840`
Yes, aside from the climate.



`516 00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,840`
So



`517 00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,840`
realistically probably the best reason to go to 44Con



`518 00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,840`
is because of the talks.



`519 00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,840`
So you get all the fun of



`520 00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,840`
all the fun of Vegas without the airfare cost



`521 00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,840`
the hotel cost, without



`522 00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,840`
being in a room with 10,000 people



`523 00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,840`
or in the same casino



`524 00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,840`
with 10,000 people.



`525 00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,840`
It's kind of



`526 00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,840`
a medium sized event



`527 00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,840`
so it's got a community feel but it's still



`528 00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,840`
quite large in areas.



`529 00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,840`
I think



`530 00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,840`
also one of the main things as well



`531 00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,840`
is the workshops. We've really pushed



`532 00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,840`
hard on workshops this year



`533 00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,840`
and the workshops that we are going to get are



`534 00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,840`
absolutely off the chart. They're two hour



`535 00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,840`
long sessions and



`536 00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,840`
we've really pushed some of the speakers



`537 00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,840`
who you would never ordinarily see do a workshop



`538 00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,840`
towards the workshops.



`539 00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,840`
So our CFP closed



`540 00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,840`
yesterday so I've still got to go through everything



`541 00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,840`
and meet with the



`542 00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,840`
CFP team and



`543 00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,840`
we'll work out who's speaking but some of the



`544 00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,840`
stuff we've seen is just amazing. It's really incredible.



`545 00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,840`
Awesome.



`546 00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,840`
Cool. And also there's Gin O'clock.



`547 00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,840`
There is indeed.



`548 00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,840`
Every afternoon we stop for gin.



`549 00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,840`
It would be rude not to.



`550 00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,840`
Well thank you Steve.



`551 00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,840`
It was a pleasure having you on our podcast.



`552 00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,840`
Thanks for having me.



`553 00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,840`
Have a good



`554 00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,840`
continuation of



`555 00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,840`
this conference. Thanks.



`556 00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,840`
Hej och välkommen till



`557 00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,840`
Säkerhetspodcasten.



`558 00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,840`
Idag så spelar vi in ifrån



`559 00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,840`
Securityfest



`560 00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,840`
i Göteborg



`561 00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,840`
och



`562 00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,840`
har lite intervjusessioner



`563 00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,840`
här med några av talarna



`564 00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,840`
och



`565 00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,840`
just nu så har jag



`566 00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,840`
Aaron Guzman. Välkommen Aaron.



`567 00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,840`
Tack.



`568 00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,840`
We've just listened



`569 00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,840`
to three



`570 00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,840`
good talks all about IoT



`571 00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,840`
and you delivered



`572 00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,840`
an excellent one.



`573 00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,840`
Tell me a little bit



`574 00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,840`
about yourself



`575 00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,840`
and bring



`576 00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,840`
in briefly about what your talk was about.



`577 00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,840`
Sure. So I'm based



`578 00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,840`
in Los Angeles.



`579 00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,840`
I'm also involved in the community in Los Angeles.



`580 00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,840`
So as a board member for



`581 00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,840`
OWASP Los Angeles as well as



`582 00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,840`
Cloud Security Alliance Southern California



`583 00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,840`
last four years now.



`584 00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,840`
I help co-organize



`585 00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,840`
our conference, our OWASP



`586 00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,840`
conference called Apps at California.



`587 00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,840`
So that's held every January.



`588 00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,840`
And we get everybody from around the world



`589 00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,840`
as well.



`590 00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,840`
But aside from that I do a lot of research within



`591 00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,840`
embedded and IoT space,



`592 00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,840`
contribute to many



`593 00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,840`
white papers and guidance documents



`594 00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,840`
with Cloud Security Alliance,



`595 00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,840`
PRPL, OWASP as well,



`596 00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,840`
as well as lead a project



`597 00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,840`
embedded application security project



`598 00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,840`
that my talk



`599 00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,840`
was based upon today.



`600 00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,840`
Just to interrupt



`601 00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,840`
you there, I mean some of our listeners



`602 00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,840`
probably know you by your Twitter handle



`603 00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,840`
ScriptingXSS.



`604 00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,840`
Yes, ScriptingXSS is my Twitter handle.



`605 00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,840`
So other research I do is



`606 00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,840`
car hacking research



`607 00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,840`
and then just general



`608 00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,840`
IoT research and consumer space



`609 00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,840`
with like



`610 00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,840`
doorbells and like I said



`611 00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,840`
connected vehicles is one.



`612 00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,840`
And the guidance with that as well



`613 00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,840`
is how I kind of balance it out.



`614 00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,840`
I guess aside from that



`615 00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,840`
let's see, what do I do?



`616 00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,840`
I guess I just love to teach



`617 00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,840`
and give back, help out



`618 00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,840`
and learn. And everywhere I go



`619 00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,840`
I always meet some crazy interesting



`620 00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,840`
smart people.



`621 00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,840`
Like last night, I mean totally



`622 00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,840`
at the speaker dinner, I learned some cool new things



`623 00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,840`
I can utilize in my research.



`624 00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,840`
That's the scary part about going to



`625 00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,840`
conferences. You realize that you're



`626 00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,840`
like a noob



`627 00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,840`
in a crowd of experts.



`628 00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,840`
Because everyone is an expert



`629 00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,840`
in their particular area.



`630 00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,840`
That's what's rewarding about going to



`631 00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,840`
conferences. Definitely, yeah.



`632 00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,840`
It's totally a great experience. But it's funny at the same



`633 00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,840`
time how our culture



`634 00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,840`
is so tightly knit. I mean,



`635 00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,840`
just hanging out with the guys here, the organizers



`636 00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,840`
I feel like, you know, I don't feel



`637 00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,840`
like an outsider



`638 00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,840`
at all. I mean, we can talk and



`639 00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,840`
converse about various subjects



`640 00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,840`
and just go one subject to another



`641 00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,840`
and then talk about different



`642 00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,840`
techniques and then learn off each other.



`643 00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,840`
Literally, like just meeting



`644 00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,840`
the guys all last night.



`645 00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,840`
That's great. And I mean, I think here



`646 00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,840`
in Sweden, Gutenberg, has a great



`647 00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,840`
community. It seems like they're very tightly



`648 00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,840`
knit from what I understand.



`649 00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,840`
Yeah, pretty strong OWSP community as well.



`650 00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,840`
Awesome.



`651 00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,840`
You were talking about



`652 00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,840`
the sort of



`653 00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,840`
supply chain of IoT stuff



`654 00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,840`
and a little bit



`655 00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,840`
you showed some demos.



`656 00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,840`
Could you tell us about



`657 00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,840`
some of the problem areas that you



`658 00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,840`
see in the IoT field?



`659 00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,840`
Sure, yeah. So I discussed



`660 00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,840`
the supply chain, how the



`661 00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,840`
embedded devices are created. And that relates to



`662 00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,840`
IoT devices because



`663 00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,840`
in essence, you know, IoT devices



`664 00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,840`
are embedded devices at its core.



`665 00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,840`
So what I noted



`666 00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,840`
as far as or emphasized on is



`667 00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,840`
the ODM supply chain aspect



`668 00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,840`
as well as the margins and



`669 00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,840`
regulatory



`670 00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,840`
incentives that maybe developers may not



`671 00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,840`
have or certain



`672 00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,840`
industry verticals as well.



`673 00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,840`
Now I noted



`674 00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,840`
that the ODMs



`675 00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,840`
are the



`676 00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,840`
basically small development firms in China, Taiwan



`677 00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,840`
who...



`678 00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,840`
Could you just briefly explain ODM



`679 00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,840`
for our listeners? Sure. Original device



`680 00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,840`
manufacturers, what ODM stands for.



`681 00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,840`
So they are the companies



`682 00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,840`
that make the hardware



`683 00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,840`
for...



`684 00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,840`
Not necessarily the hardware



`685 00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,840`
but they may...



`686 00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,840`
Modules. Sure.



`687 00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,840`
They may create



`688 00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,840`
let's say a specification



`689 00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,840`
or a product or a baseline of a product



`690 00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,840`
the hardware and the peripherals



`691 00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,840`
and they'll work



`692 00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,840`
with... So they have a PCB



`693 00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,840`
and they work with the board support package



`694 00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,840`
whichever vendor, Broadcom



`695 00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,840`
Marvell, a number of other ones who



`696 00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,840`
can support the hardware



`697 00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,840`
and the ODM builds their stack



`698 00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,840`
their software stack on top of that



`699 00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,840`
and that could be the root file



`700 00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,840`
system and let's say



`701 00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,840`
the HTTP configuration for example



`702 00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,840`
and then after that you have



`703 00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,840`
cloud service providers



`704 00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,840`
and OEMs and the OEMs are



`705 00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,840`
supporting



`706 00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,840`
the ODMs code base



`707 00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,840`
as far as



`708 00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,840`
in production and support tickets



`709 00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,840`
and security flaws



`710 00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,840`
and now



`711 00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,840`
one of the aspects of ODMs and introducing



`712 00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,840`
their SDKs



`713 00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,840`
and their APIs to OEMs



`714 00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,840`
is sometimes their



`715 00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,840`
black box binaries that



`716 00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,840`
they give to the OEMs



`717 00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,840`
so there's no way for the OEM to review the code



`718 00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,840`
and not only that



`719 00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,840`
the ODMs also introduce



`720 00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,840`
either back doors, what they call



`721 00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,840`
or their excuses is more like...



`722 00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,840`
Service ports. Yeah.



`723 00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,840`
Or debugging or for support for



`724 00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,840`
production support



`725 00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,840`
and so they're hard coded



`726 00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,840`
in the firmware image and now



`727 00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,840`
even, you know, it has nothing to do



`728 00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,840`
with the application side



`729 00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,840`
it's more of the platform, let's say embedded Linux



`730 00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,840`
for example, where they have



`731 00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,840`
a root user



`732 00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,840`
and a hard coded password that's just a hash



`733 00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,840`
so you have to crack the hash there



`734 00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,840`
to get the plain text



`735 00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,840`
password, but that



`736 00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,840`
is kind of where a lot of the threats



`737 00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,840`
like Mirai or vulnerabilities



`738 00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,840`
and exploits come out, like Mirai



`739 00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,840`
is the ODM space, Yangmai is



`740 00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,840`
held responsible for



`741 00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,840`
basically Mirai



`742 00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,840`
and then you have other



`743 00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,840`
ODM vendors as well who are affected



`744 00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,840`
so if you go to, let's say



`745 00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,840`
like a cert site



`746 00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,840`
for any cert in the world



`747 00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,840`
then you'll see a vulnerability



`748 00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,840`
that affects, let's say



`749 00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,840`
D-Link and Netgear, let's say



`750 00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,840`
it's easy to pick on



`751 00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,840`
but they're all



`752 00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,840`
all the bugs relate to their products



`753 00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,840`
because they use the same ODM



`754 00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,840`
and the ODM has a right to repackage and sell it



`755 00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,840`
to different OEMs



`756 00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,840`
as they please, or resellers



`757 00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,840`
as well.



`758 00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,840`
You also talked a little bit about



`759 00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,840`
tools that you can use to



`760 00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,840`
reverse or



`761 00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,840`
look at firmware images



`762 00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,840`
and so on, and also



`763 00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,840`
you referenced your



`764 00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,840`
GitHub



`765 00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,840`
literature



`766 00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,840`
so could you just tell us



`767 00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,840`
where should we go to find



`768 00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,840`
these goodies?



`769 00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,840`
No problem, I actually created a bit.ly



`770 00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,840`
link, it's bit.ly and it's



`771 00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,840`
firmware analysis tools, or



`772 00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,840`
alternatively you can google



`773 00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,840`
OWASP embedded appsec project



`774 00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,840`
and there's a tab on firmware analysis tools



`775 00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,840`
and the main tools I have there that are



`776 00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,840`
common in any firmware



`777 00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,840`
reverse engineering is Binwalk



`778 00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,840`
and there's another one



`779 00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,840`
called Firmodyne and Firmwalker



`780 00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,840`
and Firmodyne, it helps or



`781 00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,840`
assists with emulating a binary



`782 00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,840`
so you don't have to have the hardware device in hand



`783 00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,840`
you could stand up



`784 00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,840`
a virtual network interface



`785 00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,840`
and you can access the



`786 00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,840`
web UI for example



`787 00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,840`
and also get access to the



`788 00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,840`
file system console



`789 00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,840`
and provide research



`790 00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,840`
as if you had the product in hand



`791 00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,840`
there's some tweaks and modifications but again



`792 00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,840`
the point is to emulate



`793 00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,840`
a device without buying it



`794 00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,840`
or purchasing it and just having the firmware



`795 00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,840`
Right, and Binwalk



`796 00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,840`
for looking at



`797 00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,840`
the files with the firmware



`798 00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,840`
Yeah, the firmware itself, it extracts



`799 00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,840`
the firmware



`800 00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,840`
it basically decompresses



`801 00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,840`
and



`802 00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,840`
for example there's



`803 00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,840`
SquashFS, the file system



`804 00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,840`
it has what's called



`805 00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,840`
unsquashed



`806 00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,840`
I forgot what it's called at the moment right now



`807 00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,840`
but there's another one called Sasquatch



`808 00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,840`
for modified SquashFS



`809 00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,840`
file systems as well



`810 00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,840`
so it basically extracts the file system



`811 00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,840`
so you can navigate



`812 00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,840`
the configuration files



`813 00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,840`
or the code statically



`814 00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,840`
and view



`815 00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,840`
again let's say hard-coded credentials



`816 00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,840`
is one example I gave



`817 00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,840`
today in my talk



`818 00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,840`
Excellent, what do you



`819 00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,840`
think, I mean if you look



`820 00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,840`
at the



`821 00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,840`
area of



`822 00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,840`
IoT or embedded devices right now



`823 00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,840`
and what do you see



`824 00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,840`
in the future, will we see



`825 00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,840`
an end to the problems that relate



`826 00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,840`
to



`827 00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,840`
vulnerable



`828 00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,840`
ODM products



`829 00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,840`
that get



`830 00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,840`
proliferated into



`831 00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,840`
IoT products



`832 00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,840`
and consumer products



`833 00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,840`
because



`834 00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,840`
the way I think, it's sort of like



`835 00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,840`
if



`836 00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,840`
the basic platform is vulnerable



`837 00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,840`
and has a lot of back doors



`838 00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,840`
that



`839 00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,840`
the OEMs can't



`840 00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,840`
do anything about, they're gonna



`841 00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,840`
continue feeding the market



`842 00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,840`
with vulnerable devices that's



`843 00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,840`
a shitstorm



`844 00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,840`
waiting to happen. Yeah, that's why



`845 00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,840`
what's happening, unfortunately



`846 00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,840`
and again I think I discussed during my talk as well



`847 00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,840`
back porting



`848 00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,840`
these vulnerabilities, so say the OEMs



`849 00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,840`
are recreated and built on top



`850 00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,840`
of the ODM's original code base



`851 00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,840`
and they've built a number of different iterations



`852 00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,840`
and updates and now back porting



`853 00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,840`
let's say it's a driver that's



`854 00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,840`
affected or a piece of software



`855 00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,840`
and other dependency issues



`856 00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,840`
with that is a pain



`857 00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,840`
and not only that, the communication



`858 00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,840`
between the OEM



`859 00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,840`
who is supporting the product over to



`860 00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,840`
let's say Broadcom for example



`861 00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,840`
there is no communication there



`862 00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,840`
and an update



`863 00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,840`
path, it's very much



`864 00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,840`
a manual process and again



`865 00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,840`
as far as if an ODM's involved



`866 00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,840`
you have a



`867 00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,840`
black box binary that



`868 00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,840`
you don't know the code that's inside



`869 00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,840`
and you can't change the code, you don't have the source



`870 00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,840`
code, it's literally compiled



`871 00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,840`
and again there's also



`872 00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,840`
from another aspect there's also



`873 00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,840`
the ODM's or even the OEM



`874 00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,840`
can branch out, they want a certain feature



`875 00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,840`
that you can have access to



`876 00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,840`
for USB, like



`877 00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,840`
NetUSB is an example I gave and that's also



`878 00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,840`
contracted out



`879 00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,840`
to another third party



`880 00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,840`
who supports



`881 00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,840`
that driver, so even like Twonky



`882 00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,840`
media server that's on most of



`883 00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,840`
routers, that's the third party creating that piece of



`884 00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,840`
software and it's a



`885 00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,840`
binary that they build in



`886 00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,840`
into their end firmware image



`887 00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,840`
and then distribute it out



`888 00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,840`
so there's a lot of different hands, a lot of different



`889 00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,840`
black box code



`890 00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,840`
that is not



`891 00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,840`
there isn't a source



`892 00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,840`
code that they can modify and change themselves



`893 00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,840`
it's holding the



`894 00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,840`
ODM's in a way



`895 00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,840`
accountable if they're creating



`896 00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,840`
new products, for old products



`897 00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,840`
it's hard to even



`898 00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,840`
gain those discussions and gain



`899 00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,840`
traction to get them to fix



`900 00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,840`
and spend time, because time is money



`901 00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,840`
to fix these security issues



`902 00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,840`
that's also one thing that I was



`903 00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,840`
thinking about because we're



`904 00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,840`
talking about very very low



`905 00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,840`
margin products



`906 00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,840`
so how



`907 00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,840`
could you persuade



`908 00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,840`
a market that's



`909 00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,840`
basically counting cents



`910 00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,840`
and counting



`911 00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,840`
clock cycles on their



`912 00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,840`
small processors and weighing



`913 00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,840`
memory bytes



`914 00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,840`
on golden scales



`915 00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,840`
because the



`916 00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,840`
space is so cramped



`917 00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,840`
how could you convince them that they need to do



`918 00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,840`
security right



`919 00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,840`
from the start, I mean



`920 00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,840`
that's going to cost a lot of money



`921 00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,840`
and unless you have that as a



`922 00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,840`
selling point, I think those



`923 00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,840`
businesses going that path



`924 00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,840`
will be out of business because



`925 00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,840`
they're going to one, not be



`926 00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,840`
first to market and two



`927 00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,840`
their product is going to be



`928 00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,840`
you know, two dollars more expensive



`929 00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,840`
than



`930 00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,840`
the next guy and he's selling



`931 00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,840`
his product for like two cents or



`932 00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,840`
five cents, you know



`933 00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,840`
Sure, yeah definitely



`934 00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,840`
I mean consumer space wise, that's a problem



`935 00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,840`
even in the industrial control system



`936 00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,840`
space where they're relying on



`937 00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,840`
these embedded XP devices



`938 00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,840`
or even servers who are controlling



`939 00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,840`
these legacy medical devices



`940 00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,840`
these are millions of dollars



`941 00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,840`
and heavily dependent



`942 00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,840`
on devices



`943 00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,840`
and infrastructure and to update it's like



`944 00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,840`
do I want to spend another three thousand because they're vulnerable



`945 00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,840`
to this, let's just segment, you know



`946 00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,840`
and that's another problem because



`947 00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,840`
their vendor, let's say like Siemens for example



`948 00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,840`
they don't provide an update



`949 00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,840`
that is no longer supported and now



`950 00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,840`
you know, they're stuck with it



`951 00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,840`
in 2017



`952 00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,840`
I work a lot with



`953 00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,840`
SCADA and industrial control systems



`954 00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,840`
so I know of that



`955 00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,840`
and that's definitely not



`956 00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,840`
a low margin market



`957 00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,840`
because you have huge markups



`958 00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,840`
on



`959 00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,840`
very



`960 00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,840`
very small



`961 00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,840`
and simple devices



`962 00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,840`
that they charge you an arm and a leg



`963 00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,840`
for, so



`964 00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,840`
It's like the other end of the spectrum really when you think about



`965 00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,840`
a regulated space where it's really really expensive



`966 00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,840`
and then they're heavily dependent on to update



`967 00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,840`
and then there's no updates and you have



`968 00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,840`
the consumer side where



`969 00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,840`
there's no incentive and regulation



`970 00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,840`
to influence



`971 00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,840`
secure software



`972 00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,840`
or secure devices



`973 00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,840`
or secure by design or implementing that



`974 00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,840`
in a life cycle of building



`975 00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,840`
of building IoT. I like that you



`976 00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,840`
also talked about what



`977 00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,840`
to do and how you should go about



`978 00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,840`
creating



`979 00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,840`
secure products or



`980 00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,840`
secure software and I guess that's



`981 00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,840`
from your OWASP engagement



`982 00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,840`
One thing I really liked



`983 00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,840`
was that you talked about doing



`984 00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,840`
threat models and I think that's



`985 00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,840`
probably one of the



`986 00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,840`
best tools you can



`987 00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,840`
use to find



`988 00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,840`
design



`989 00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,840`
flaws early on in a project



`990 00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,840`
and I'm amazed that



`991 00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,840`
not a lot of companies do that



`992 00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,840`
because it doesn't cost much



`993 00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,840`
and you could find so



`994 00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,840`
many things early on in a project



`995 00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,840`
And it's a learning exercise



`996 00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,840`
you'd often find that different teams



`997 00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,840`
they're stuck in their silo



`998 00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,840`
and they're stuck only



`999 00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,840`
developing this one feature



`1000 00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,840`
they don't know how the whole ecosystem



`1001 00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,840`
say they're an embedded developer



`1002 00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,840`
they don't know how the cloud side works



`1003 00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,840`
the infrastructure team and then the big data side



`1004 00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,840`
but getting each team



`1005 00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,840`
in a room for



`1006 00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,840`
either a day or span it out



`1007 00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,840`
it's a good learning exercise for all



`1008 00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,840`
and they can definitely



`1009 00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,840`
match the low hanging fruit



`1010 00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,840`
and be like yeah



`1011 00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,840`
obviously now that we have it drawn out



`1012 00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,840`
it looks like a major problem



`1013 00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,840`
and it could affect not only us



`1014 00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,840`
our customers but also our infrastructure



`1015 00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,840`
and our name so let's see how we can rework this



`1016 00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,840`
those are fun



`1017 00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,840`
then they start getting on the same page



`1018 00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,840`
like oh we're on the same team



`1019 00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,840`
we're not here as far as security is concerned



`1020 00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,840`
blame game



`1021 00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,840`
so it's about the culture



`1022 00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,840`
but yeah threat modeling



`1023 00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,840`
huge huge huge as far as the impact it can cause



`1024 00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,840`
I think it's



`1025 00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,840`
important in any piece of software



`1026 00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,840`
any device



`1027 00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,840`
you don't see that a lot



`1028 00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,840`
I know Microsoft



`1029 00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,840`
has been a champion organization



`1030 00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,840`
for doing that



`1031 00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,840`
with their SDL



`1032 00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,840`
program but



`1033 00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,840`
you don't see a lot of software companies



`1034 00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,840`
doing



`1035 00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,840`
that today either



`1036 00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,840`
so at least not



`1037 00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,840`
if you're looking at startups



`1038 00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,840`
because in a startup you're just trying to



`1039 00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,840`
make time to market



`1040 00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,840`
that's key



`1041 00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,840`
and you want to throw out a product



`1042 00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,840`
sort of like what Steve was talking about



`1043 00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,840`
in his keynote



`1044 00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,840`
so that's the thing



`1045 00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,840`
also the other side



`1046 00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,840`
we hope that the OEMs



`1047 00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,840`
will push



`1048 00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,840`
the ODMs to



`1049 00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,840`
build more secure software



`1050 00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,840`
the more mature OEMs would



`1051 00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,840`
but this is the part of IOT



`1052 00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,840`
these new products



`1053 00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,840`
that are being rapidly developed



`1054 00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,840`
and starter development kits



`1055 00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,840`
that make



`1056 00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,840`
creating and deploying



`1057 00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,840`
and selling these devices



`1058 00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,840`
super super simple



`1059 00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,840`
it's common



`1060 00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,840`
if you were to build something or write software



`1061 00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,840`
you want it to work first



`1062 00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,840`
and then bolt everything else afterwards



`1063 00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,840`
and you don't even think



`1064 00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,840`
it's so far gone



`1065 00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,840`
interdependencies and things like that



`1066 00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,840`
but the rapid development of IOT



`1067 00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,840`
I don't know if it's a problem



`1068 00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,840`
but it's just a matter of



`1069 00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,840`
we can make security easier



`1070 00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,840`
and faster for them to implement in their life cycle



`1071 00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,840`
otherwise it's not going to happen



`1072 00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,840`
it's not going to work



`1073 00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,840`
if we can't implement something



`1074 00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,840`
that's within their IDE



`1075 00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,840`
as a plugin for static



`1076 00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,840`
and then for dynamic with their builds



`1077 00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,840`
and their tools



`1078 00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,840`
as far as integrate with their tools



`1079 00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,840`
I think that's the best way to go



`1080 00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,840`
otherwise statically



`1081 00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,840`
having a security team and pen test



`1082 00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,840`
and researchers



`1083 00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,840`
it doesn't scale



`1084 00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,840`
Awesome, Aaron



`1085 00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,840`
Thanks for a great talk today



`1086 00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,840`
and thanks for taking time to talk to us



`1087 00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,840`
and bring some wisdom to our listeners



`1088 00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,840`
Awesome, thank you so much



`1089 00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,840`
Thank you for having me



`1090 00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,840`
Have a great day



`1091 00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,840`
So, that was all for this interview



`1092 00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,840`
and hopefully we will come up with



`1093 00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,840`
more of this



`1094 00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,840`
You can listen to the security podcast



`1095 00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,840`
in the next episode



`1096 00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,840`
Thank you for watching



`1097 00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,840`
and see you next time



`1098 00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,840`
Bye
