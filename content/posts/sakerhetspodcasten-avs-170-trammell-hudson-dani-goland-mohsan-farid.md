`1 00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880`
Välkomna tillbaka till SEK, Jesper Karlsson live från SEK-T, nästan live.



`2 00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,540`
Nästan live, broadcast.



`3 00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,940`
Exakt, broadcasting, inte streaming. Det var en viktig poäng jag gjorde igår.



`4 00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,120`
Jag sitter här med Jesper Larsson och Hudson Trammell.



`5 00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,420`
Nej, Trammell Hudson.



`6 00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:15,580`
Ja, jag har gjort det förbättrat.



`7 00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,300`
Det funkar på båda sätt.



`8 00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,320`
Så vi har bara lyssnat på en riktigt fantastisk tal. Vad var det om?



`9 00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:26,480`
Den här talen var om min forskning om att bygga hardware-implantationer för



`10 00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,560`
board management controllers, VMCs.



`11 00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:33,640`
Den var inspirerad av Bloomberg-historien, den stora hacken från förra året.



`12 00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,440`
Jag försökte utforska vad som är den tekniska tillgängligheten



`13 00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:44,560`
av dessa implanter, utan att försöka erkänna att vi inte vet



`14 00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:50,760`
om historien hände eller inte, men tekniskt sett är de helt tillgängliga.



`15 00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,800`
Ja, korrekt. Jag tror att din forskning var väldigt bra,



`16 00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,760`
för du besökte hela...



`17 00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:03,440`
Vad var det om? Var det på din helgdag, eller var det bara att du skulle gå till Kina och titta på det?



`18 00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,440`
Varför gjorde du det?



`19 00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:12,780`
Jag hade en fantastisk möjlighet att tura i en mängd PCB-manufacturing som en vän av mig



`20 00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:18,660`
hade gjort en tura genom de här fabrikerna för några start-ups i Silicon Valley



`21 00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:21,700`
så att de kunde se vad som var involverat i att göra en fysisk produkt.



`22 00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,440`
Jag var invigd att tagga med och verkligen...



`23 00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,480`
Jag tog upp en möjlighet.



`24 00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,480`
Ja, förstås. En fin vän att ha, eller hur?



`25 00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,480`
Det såg jättekul ut.



`26 00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,480`
Det var faktiskt en väldigt spännande del av din berättelse, tror jag,



`27 00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,480`
för det gav mig en insikt som jag aldrig hade förut,



`28 00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,480`
hur manufaktureringen faktiskt händer.



`29 00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,480`
Det är väldigt spännande.



`30 00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:48,480`
Ja, och det är intressant hur mycket som är koncentrerat i Shenzhen-området.



`31 00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,480`
Ja.



`32 00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,480`
Så de som jag kunde fotografera var några av de små manufaktureringarna.



`33 00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,480`
Jag hade möjlighet att turera några mycket större, men de hade...



`34 00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,480`
Inga fotografer.



`35 00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:05,480`
Men en av dem hade flyttat till 100% X-ray



`36 00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:09,480`
av bordarna som kommer ut för vissa höga förvaltningskustnader.



`37 00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,480`
Ja.



`38 00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,480`
Och de hade också...



`39 00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,480`
Som effekt av den här artikeln, eller bara som kvalitetsförvaltning?



`40 00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,480`
De ramlade den från samling till 100%, tror jag.



`41 00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,480`
Okej, förstås.



`42 00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,480`
Och speciellt kring implant.



`43 00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,480`
Ja, för implant i det här fallet.



`44 00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,480`
I stället för att bara kolla för förhållandena som finns och sådant.



`45 00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:36,480`
Ja, det var ganska vanligt för höga förvaltningskustnader



`46 00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,480`
om man bygger flyg- eller luftkraftkostnader för att X-raya dem alla.



`47 00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:45,480`
Men att göra det för komputerprodukter var bara för att verifiera



`48 00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,480`
att manufaktureringsprocesserna var...



`49 00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,480`
Upp till par.



`50 00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,480`
Upp till par, att färgerna såg bra ut och så vidare.



`51 00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,480`
Ja.



`52 00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,480`
Men i aviationsindustrin och i oljeindustrin



`53 00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,480`
X-rayar du många av dina väldar för att se att du inte har krav på något



`54 00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,480`
eftersom det är väldigt hög press och så vidare.



`55 00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,480`
Men här gör det senare att se att du får vad du får.



`56 00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,480`
Du visade en riktigt fin bild om en falsk RSU-3-2-skip.



`57 00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,480`
Det var ganska kul när de X-rayade...



`58 00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,480`
När de... Vad heter det?



`59 00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,480`
Decapsulerade.



`60 00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,480`
Decapsulerade, ja.



`61 00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,480`
Det är helt annorlunda.



`62 00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,480`
Ja.



`63 00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,480`
Men det ser exakt samma ut på ytan.



`64 00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,480`
Så det finns...



`65 00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,480`
Jag gick inte in på det i talet, men det finns...



`66 00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,480`
Det finns flera olika typer av kontrakter som folk är oroliga för.



`67 00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:30,480`
Det finns de som jag nämnde med de salvagerade delarna.



`68 00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,480`
Det finns de där vissa delar är skapade på vad som kallas för en ghost shift.



`69 00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,480`
Där...



`70 00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,480`
Vi går hem nu, men låt oss göra 1000 mer.



`71 00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,480`
Exakt.



`72 00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,480`
Det är exakt samma produkt.



`73 00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,480`
Ja.



`74 00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,480`
Och sen finns det de andra som är...



`75 00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,480`
Samtidigt.



`76 00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,480`
Där...



`77 00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,480`
Och sen har de dem paketat för att se ut som samma chip



`78 00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,480`
men inuti är det en helt annorlunda process.



`79 00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,480`
Och från en säkerhetsperspektiv...



`80 00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,480`
Det är faktiskt den skrämmigaste.



`81 00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,480`
Ja.



`82 00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,480`
För vem vet vilken annan funktionalitet...



`83 00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,480`
Kan hittas.



`84 00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,480`
Ja.



`85 00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,480`
Det är riktigt galet.



`86 00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,480`
Vi hade en avsnitt om det här där vi diskuterade det här i detalj.



`87 00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,480`
Och det enda...



`88 00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,480`
Det...



`89 00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:16,480`
Du har gjort det absolut klart för alla i publiken



`90 00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,480`
och alla på internet nu att det här är möjligt.



`91 00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,480`
Det här kan faktiskt göras.



`92 00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,480`
Men...



`93 00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:26,480`
Det är så mycket arbete som är utsatt för att göra det här.



`94 00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,480`
Det är så stort.



`95 00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,480`
Man måste interceptera.



`96 00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,480`
Om det går att göra det på skala.



`97 00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,480`
Man måste gå in till produktionen och allt.



`98 00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,480`
Men eftersom alla negerar det...



`99 00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,480`
Varför var det där?



`100 00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,480`
Vad var artikeln?



`101 00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,480`
Varför kom det fram?



`102 00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,480`
Vad tror ni?



`103 00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,480`
Varför var artikeln på Bloomberg?



`104 00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,480`
Jag är inte säker på att någon intelligensagent



`105 00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,480`
skulle vilja göra det på skala.



`106 00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,480`
Ja, du vill ha ett mål.



`107 00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:54,160`
I think they would want to target



`108 00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,840`
a very small number of customers.



`109 00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,540`
It helps a whole lot for containment



`110 00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:03,260`
if you're only going after one.



`111 00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,720`
Otherwise anyone who buys a Supermicro board



`112 00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,860`
could potentially find this sort of thing.



`113 00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,380`
You're exposing yourself way too much.



`114 00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:14,580`
As I pointed out, the targeted access operations



`115 00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,460`
lets them tailor it to a single customer.



`116 00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:23,100`
That makes a lot more sense, as you mentioned as well.



`117 00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,660`
Intercepting something that's going to a specific customer.



`118 00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,300`
Then it's not a supply chain attack though.



`119 00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,940`
Then you just short ship it and put your implant in.



`120 00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,580`
That's more feasible.



`121 00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,020`
It's supply chain from the perspective of the customer.



`122 00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,260`
It's just not in the manufacturing process.



`123 00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:46,680`
As I pointed out, Supermicro was very clear in their letter



`124 00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,440`
that all of their protections



`125 00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,120`
are on the manufacturing process.



`126 00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,840`
Once it leaves their factory, it's hard for them to control.



`127 00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,180`
It makes sense.



`128 00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,760`
Do we think that this actually occurred?



`129 00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,900`
Or do we think, as my opinion,



`130 00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,360`
was this a short in the stock market for Supermicro?



`131 00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,760`
I really tried to avoid speculating



`132 00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,920`
about any of the motivations



`133 00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,600`
for why the story appeared,



`134 00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,960`
when it appeared, and so on.



`135 00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,640`
It seems to me that they had been working on it



`136 00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,620`
for a really long time.



`137 00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:27,660`
In the article, Bloomberg mentions that they had been talking to sources



`138 00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:34,580`
going back almost to the 2015-2016 time frame.



`139 00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,020`
It had been a multi-year story.



`140 00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,100`
I don't know what was involved



`141 00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,960`
in their timing decision.



`142 00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,200`
Because everyone that was named in the story



`143 00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,980`
has denied it.



`144 00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,660`
Oh, there's one guy, right?



`145 00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,020`
Apple and Amazon.



`146 00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,300`
Oh yeah, yeah.



`147 00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,700`
Don't you find it strange that they haven't



`148 00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,940`
retracted the story?



`149 00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:02,100`
I find it very strange that they haven't retracted



`150 00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,320`
or provided more detail.



`151 00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,020`
It seems that if...



`152 00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,780`
They have made statements



`153 00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,740`
that they're confident in their sourcing



`154 00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:14,000`
and that the editors are confident



`155 00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,140`
in the anonymous sources.



`156 00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,160`
And typically,



`157 00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,960`
a news organization,



`158 00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,460`
the editors will meet with



`159 00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,380`
or know who the anonymous sources are.



`160 00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,580`
It's not that the reporters can't just say,



`161 00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,320`
oh, I talked to some guy and he told me this.



`162 00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,620`
The editors will say...



`163 00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,560`
And it has to be fact-checked



`164 00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,600`
and reference-checked.



`165 00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,020`
Who knows how



`166 00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,660`
what it's called, the SPI looks like.



`167 00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,940`
If you get a schematics of something,



`168 00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,480`
how could you as a journalist



`169 00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,160`
source the truth out of that?



`170 00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:44,580`
I don't know.



`171 00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,520`
You need to have references.



`172 00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,660`
Maybe in a...



`173 00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:47,960`
In a certain way,



`174 00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,180`
maybe Bloomberg is trying to save face



`175 00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,920`
by not retracting



`176 00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,240`
and standing by their claims.



`177 00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,080`
And like, well...



`178 00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,780`
All could be one case.



`179 00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,880`
We can't tell you our sources.



`180 00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,660`
So you're just going to have to take our word for it.



`181 00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,720`
But the argument is solid, I think.



`182 00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,940`
It's really sound that



`183 00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,440`
since this is an ongoing...



`184 00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,140`
You can actually see



`185 00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,660`
that it's a lot of work behind it.



`186 00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,700`
And then it sort of makes sense



`187 00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,040`
that there is actually...



`188 00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,580`
They've been working on it for a long time.



`189 00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,020`
So, yeah.



`190 00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:14,400`
Yeah.



`191 00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,120`
Yeah.



`192 00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,660`
I don't think that legitimizes...



`193 00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,540`
Not just legitimize the whole thing in itself,



`194 00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,540`
but still it's like, yeah.



`195 00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,360`
There is something there.



`196 00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,520`
I'm getting scared.



`197 00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,560`
There must be...



`198 00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,360`
I mean, obviously we don't know the full story



`199 00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:29,980`
as you mentioned,



`200 00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,460`
but it's certainly feasible.



`201 00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000`
And there's probably a grain of truth



`202 00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,640`
or a grain of rice.



`203 00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:40,160`
Yes, I think there's a rice grain sized...



`204 00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:40,620`
Exactly.



`205 00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,460`
Yeah, implant.



`206 00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,460`
And the...



`207 00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,460`
My feeling is that...



`208 00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,880`
It very well might have been a TAO type thing.



`209 00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,360`
I would not be surprised



`210 00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:57,460`
if there are lots of these sort of TAO implants out there.



`211 00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,660`
And they're going to get harder and harder to find.



`212 00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,200`
That the...



`213 00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:08,060`
Again, with a zero budget sort of capability,



`214 00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:14,640`
you can still produce quite a bit of interesting implants.



`215 00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,200`
And the...



`216 00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,240`
The NSA Playset group



`217 00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,900`
has been making a lot of recreations of things



`218 00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,100`
out of the Ant Catalog



`219 00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,820`
with basically hobbyist budget.



`220 00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,220`
And people are now bundling all sorts of electronics



`221 00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,080`
into USB cables



`222 00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,720`
that are, again, being done by hobbyists



`223 00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,820`
with equipment at home.



`224 00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,000`
It's...



`225 00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,880`
Yeah, the latest one was the Apple...



`226 00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,920`
Thunderbolt charger.



`227 00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,140`
Thunderbolt charger, yeah.



`228 00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:47,460`
Yeah.



`229 00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:50,720`
And if you tear apart a Thunderbolt cable,



`230 00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,500`
did you know that there are CPUs in the cables



`231 00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,160`
in both ends?



`232 00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:55,660`
I had no idea.



`233 00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,200`
That they...



`234 00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,840`
And they have firmware.



`235 00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:02,260`
And in fact, if you plug a cable in,



`236 00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,200`
sometimes it'll tell you...



`237 00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,640`
Your device will ask you to please...



`238 00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,360`
Yeah, unlock to use the...



`239 00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,820`
Well, with the...



`240 00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,560`
It wants to update the firmware in the cable,



`241 00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,720`
but it can only update the local end.



`242 00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,020`
But they can negotiate with the other end and say,



`243 00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,020`
oh, this end...



`244 00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,980`
This end is running a different version from the other end.



`245 00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:19,800`
Oh, my God.



`246 00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,360`
Please turn the cable around.



`247 00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,240`
I didn't know about this.



`248 00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,880`
So that it can update the other end as well.



`249 00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:24,680`
Oh, that's crazy.



`250 00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,700`
That's insane.



`251 00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:26,860`
Yeah, and...



`252 00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:32,260`
You know, Moore's Law has given us just microscopic CPUs.



`253 00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,500`
Yeah, you showed it in your slide as well.



`254 00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,600`
This Cortex...



`255 00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,320`
The ARM Cortex processor is like really, really, really...



`256 00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,380`
The size of two transistors in a 65-bit deal.



`257 00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,200`
It's incredible how much Moore's Law...



`258 00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,080`
You know...



`259 00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,920`
Has meant in terms of transistor density.



`260 00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:50,220`
Yeah.



`261 00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:51,960`
Yeah, and that means, obviously,



`262 00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,720`
it's going to be almost impossible to detect.



`263 00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:55,080`
Yeah.



`264 00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:00,060`
And, like, you guys said, like, this will be feasible,



`265 00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,220`
because it's...



`266 00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:01,360`
Yeah.



`267 00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,480`
Why not, right?



`268 00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,020`
Yeah, but just going back to the Bloomberg story,



`269 00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,380`
because I can't quite remember,



`270 00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,080`
but they mentioned that the implant was laminated



`271 00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,560`
between the PCBs in that story.



`272 00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,620`
So in the story, they mentioned that their sources



`273 00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,760`
had found a number of implants,



`274 00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,280`
I don't remember the specific number,



`275 00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,700`
one of which was the signal coupling capacitor,



`276 00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,960`
or signal coupling...



`277 00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,240`
Sorry.



`278 00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,480`
Signal conditioning coupler.



`279 00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:27,900`
Right.



`280 00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,480`
The size of a grain of rice.



`281 00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:34,000`
And then an additional implant was the one laminated inside the PCB.



`282 00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:37,700`
And it is relatively...



`283 00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:41,960`
I wouldn't say common, but it's...



`284 00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:46,560`
Occasionally you will find embedded passives in PCBs.



`285 00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:46,740`
Mm.



`286 00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:51,160`
It's a very expensive process to have it manufactured that way.



`287 00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,280`
But it is, if you go to a PCB house,



`288 00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:55,400`
that is something that they will offer to do for you.



`289 00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:55,660`
Yeah.



`290 00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,240`
But that also means that, in that case,



`291 00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,720`
it would have to be part of the manufacturing process



`292 00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,800`
where the implants take place.



`293 00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,540`
This is where the cover story completely breaks down,



`294 00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,120`
because it's obvious when it happened.



`295 00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:14,820`
Now, I've also, for the hack-in-the-box talk



`296 00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:15,800`
where I was bypassing...



`297 00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,200`
I did build a small proof of concept



`298 00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,880`
that was 0.6 millimeters thick



`299 00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,780`
and would fit underneath the flash chip.



`300 00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,340`
So you could desolder the flash chip...



`301 00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,040`
Yeah, and put it...



`302 00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,440`
Oh, that's nice.



`303 00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,020`
And that was...



`304 00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,620`
Unless you were really looking for it...



`305 00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,280`
Yeah, you wouldn't be able to see it.



`306 00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,760`
And this would fit in a laptop with the cover closed.



`307 00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,020`
This is really cool stuff.



`308 00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,900`
So that, again, zero-budget sort of attack.



`309 00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,200`
Yeah.



`310 00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,200`
But the fact that we can fit an FPGA



`311 00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,380`
and a small flash memory and a voltage regulator



`312 00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:52,560`
in this microscopic size...



`313 00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,640`
That's crazy.



`314 00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:57,800`
And going back to what Joe Fitzpatrick pointed out,



`315 00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,600`
no one knows what's supposed to be in their hardware anyway.



`316 00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,220`
So if you open your laptop



`317 00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:05,220`
and there's a riser card underneath your flash chip...



`318 00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,800`
Well, maybe it should be there, right?



`319 00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,860`
Oh, this is scary stuff.



`320 00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,060`
But, so, yeah.



`321 00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:15,160`
I mean, this is only going to get worse, I suppose you could say.



`322 00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,280`
So we need open hardware for everyone.



`323 00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:16,940`
Period.



`324 00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,680`
It helps.



`325 00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:23,720`
It does mean that motivated customers



`326 00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,180`
could validate what they have.



`327 00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,640`
But again, in a TAO sort of thing,



`328 00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,660`
it would be very hard to tell



`329 00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:36,440`
how many do you need to sample



`330 00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,200`
to determine if you're being targeted.



`331 00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,540`
Right, and obviously you only need one



`332 00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,200`
from an attacker's point of view.



`333 00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,340`
One wonderful thing from an attacker's point of view



`334 00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:50,580`
on the BMC is once you have code execution on one,



`335 00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,840`
they typically share a common VLAN



`336 00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,100`
or a common network segment between all the BMCs.



`337 00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,800`
So horizontal movement becomes very easy.



`338 00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,060`
So everyone listening to this,



`339 00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,780`
you should throw out your computer,



`340 00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,700`
buy a RISC-V,



`341 00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,160`
and open hardware for the win.



`342 00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:12,300`
Yeah, open hardware and then the capability



`343 00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,640`
of analyzing all your hardware on a microscopic level.



`344 00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,160`
I'm imagining changing computers every other year.



`345 00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,020`
That would be terrible.



`346 00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,760`
So not again\!



`347 00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:25,320`
Yeah, I mean, just being able to actually verify,



`348 00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,860`
even if you have the specs,



`349 00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,320`
this is exactly how it's supposed to be.



`350 00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,060`
Actually looking through it and verifying



`351 00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,900`
that nothing is added or removed.



`352 00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,740`
Right, and doing that on the hardware level is difficult.



`353 00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,260`
On the software level,



`354 00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:43,180`
we perhaps have some ability to do it.



`355 00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:46,260`
I'm a big fan of hardware research,



`356 00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:46,960`
roots of trust,



`357 00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,940`
and what's called remote attestation,



`358 00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,720`
where the system is able to cryptographically



`359 00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,660`
sign something saying,



`360 00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:57,060`
this is the firmware and the kernel



`361 00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,860`
and the init RD and the configuration



`362 00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,320`
that is actually running on the machine,



`363 00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,600`
which potentially gives you the ability



`364 00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,860`
to detect if something has been modified along the way.



`365 00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,260`
If not, it's incorporated in the CPU



`366 00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,660`
or somewhere where it's...



`367 00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,100`
Exactly.



`368 00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,220`
So then it sort of fails.



`369 00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:16,820`
Right, right.



`370 00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,580`
But I know what you mean.



`371 00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:22,020`
Like with, what is this called, TPM and...



`372 00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,300`
What's the...



`373 00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,600`
Now my brain is fried.



`374 00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:25,840`
Already?



`375 00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,420`
It doesn't matter.



`376 00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,560`
Oh yeah, carry on.



`377 00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:32,480`
Yeah, I mean, but this is a very, very hard problem to solve,



`378 00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,960`
I think, because you can usually go one step further



`379 00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,860`
or put your implant somewhere else



`380 00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,980`
or move to software or firmware.



`381 00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,080`
Both or all of them.



`382 00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,080`
Right, although if the root of trust is...



`383 00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:50,520`
is well designed and well secured,



`384 00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,140`
an attacker who modifies the firmware



`385 00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:57,360`
would be detected in the attestation phase.



`386 00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,060`
But the idea is that you don't necessarily care



`387 00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,100`
what has been run afterwards



`388 00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:05,560`
as long as you can prove which,



`389 00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,540`
the hash of...



`390 00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,160`
Yeah, what part was manipulated



`391 00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,220`
and sort of directly get a reference or a warning



`392 00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,660`
that, hey, this is not how it's supposed to be.



`393 00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,500`
Right, right.



`394 00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:20,200`
So there are a few examples of this in use.



`395 00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:23,540`
For instance, Chromebooks will attest to Google



`396 00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,500`
the version of Coreboot



`397 00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,200`
and the Linux kernel that they have loaded



`398 00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,500`
before you log in to Google.



`399 00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,980`
And Google can say,



`400 00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,260`
this is a modified Chromebook,



`401 00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,660`
maybe you shouldn't trust it



`402 00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,760`
through that remote attestation.



`403 00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,900`
That's cool, that's cool.



`404 00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,420`
I think we need to have this sort of capability



`405 00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,820`
across all of the systems.



`406 00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:45,260`
Yeah.



`407 00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,180`
There's a need...



`408 00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:46,220`
There's a need...



`409 00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:46,320`
There's a need...



`410 00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,160`
There's a need project from MoVad



`411 00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,660`
called System Transparency



`412 00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,700`
where they want their servers



`413 00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,440`
to be able to attest to you, the user,



`414 00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,000`
that it has not been tampered with.



`415 00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,160`
And I think this sort of mutual remote attestation



`416 00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,260`
gives us a potential future.



`417 00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,920`
Yeah, I mean, that's a good way to go.



`418 00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,320`
I mean, if we can get there.



`419 00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,900`
But then again, there's firmware everywhere.



`420 00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,300`
There really is.



`421 00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,500`
So it's not going to be easy.



`422 00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,200`
But hopefully...



`423 00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,400`
Hopefully we can get closer anyway.



`424 00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,040`
Hopefully.



`425 00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,940`
Yeah, with talks like this,



`426 00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:21,900`
shedding light on it,



`427 00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,720`
I think it's a really good step in the right direction.



`428 00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,940`
And MoVad as well,



`429 00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,040`
presenting this system transparency stuff



`430 00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:28,580`
is really good.



`431 00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,140`
Yeah, definitely.



`432 00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,200`
It's going to be interesting to see



`433 00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,120`
if anything else comes to the Bloomberg article.



`434 00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,860`
I would like a follow-up at some point.



`435 00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,700`
That would be really awesome to read.



`436 00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,080`
Perhaps next year at SEC-T



`437 00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,420`
we'll have two years on.



`438 00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:41,800`
What do we know?



`439 00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,980`
We'll keep going until someone says something.



`440 00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:45,920`
Yeah.



`441 00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:46,400`
All right.



`442 00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,860`
Do you have anything else to ask?



`443 00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,420`
I think we're good.



`444 00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,920`
I think it was really nice meeting you



`445 00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,520`
and really nice listening to you talk.



`446 00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,080`
Really good.



`447 00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,740`
Thank you for having me on the podcast.



`448 00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,460`
Thank you very much.



`449 00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,040`
And we'll see you guys again



`450 00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,500`
just in a little bit.



`451 00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:58,500`
Have a good time.



`452 00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,700`
So hello and welcome to this special



`453 00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,680`
with Securets Podcast and SEC-T.



`454 00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,320`
We are interviewing some of the speakers



`455 00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,800`
on the conference.



`456 00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,460`
And now we're having



`457 00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,820`
Danny Golan back



`458 00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,960`
for the second time today.



`459 00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,120`
And Mo Sanfrid.



`460 00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,360`
Mo Sanfrid, yes.



`461 00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,280`
Very welcome.



`462 00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,020`
Thank you for having us.



`463 00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,500`
Yeah, really nice having you here.



`464 00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,740`
It was a cool talk.



`465 00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,300`
It was a little bit about everything.



`466 00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,800`
It was some exploitation



`467 00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,020`
and some post-exploitation



`468 00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,460`
and then some hardening



`469 00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:39,180`
and takeaways on how you should



`470 00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,980`
manage your resources in the cloud.



`471 00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,180`
And how you should manage.



`472 00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,760`
Mostly how you should manage your resources in the cloud.



`473 00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,140`
And I think most of our...



`474 00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,700`
So we actually got to this talk.



`475 00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,100`
He's an internal pen tester.



`476 00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,100`
I'm not.



`477 00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,700`
I've never worked like AD.



`478 00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,920`
I did web pen testing.



`479 00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,240`
I did app pen testing.



`480 00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,840`
Cloud because as a CTO



`481 00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,940`
I work in our infrastructure.



`482 00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,200`
DevOps, DevSecOps.



`483 00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:06,020`
And I enjoy having my nights



`484 00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,840`
and trying to break our own cloud.



`485 00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,900`
So that's how I found a bunch of vulnerabilities



`486 00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,500`
or right tools to mitigate that.



`487 00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,460`
And then we spoke about it.



`488 00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,640`
And we're like,



`489 00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,420`
companies are moving these days to the cloud.



`490 00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,960`
But then the move is not...



`491 00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,540`
It was actually a question from Defcon.



`492 00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,980`
We were speaking in Defcon Cloud Village.



`493 00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,240`
And someone asked me,



`494 00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,020`
why is there a connection between them?



`495 00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,320`
And then you think about it.



`496 00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,020`
A company cannot go cloud native in a day.



`497 00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,920`
Take a big company.



`498 00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,120`
All it is is a progression.



`499 00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,060`
So while the progression,



`500 00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,640`
they'll have some kind of tunnel



`501 00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,660`
between.



`502 00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,720`
So we were talking about,



`503 00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,420`
let's go through a tunnel.



`504 00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,600`
Let's try to...



`505 00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,600`
See what we can do.



`506 00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,900`
The cloud is, I feel it's like less mature



`507 00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:48,660`
in terms of protection



`508 00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,340`
than internal systems.



`509 00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,020`
I mean, you've had...



`510 00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:51,820`
Both yes and no.



`511 00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,240`
Like if you really want to protect your stuff



`512 00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,420`
in AVS, you can.



`513 00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,360`
But it's a lot of work.



`514 00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,620`
So people tend not to maybe implement all of it.



`515 00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:58,960`
True.



`516 00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,800`
But in terms of products as well.



`517 00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,260`
Think about how many products you have



`518 00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,240`
for on-premises.



`519 00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,480`
Well, yeah, that's true.



`520 00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,760`
Like for an internal active directory topology,



`521 00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,740`
there is a lot of stuff.



`522 00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,620`
And there's a lot of mitigations in place as well.



`523 00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,920`
But the funny part with Windows applications



`524 00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:13,960`
or the Microsoft applications,



`525 00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,260`
you know, the Microsoft realm



`526 00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,940`
of managing assets in an enterprise, right?



`527 00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,120`
It's pretty hard



`528 00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,600`
because they need to be backwards compatibility.



`529 00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,060`
Yeah, that's one of their killing heels.



`530 00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,100`
Yeah, you sort of showed a lot of broadcasting protocols



`531 00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,400`
that are easily exploited.



`532 00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,460`
And I think the twist



`533 00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,320`
where you're talking about having a VPC



`534 00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,560`
or a site-to-site VPN



`535 00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,840`
to your cloud-native environment,



`536 00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:37,120`
that sort of is a really good vector



`537 00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,000`
because it's really valuable.



`538 00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,140`
It could happen.



`539 00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:42,220`
And also, the thing I noticed about cloud, right?



`540 00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,360`
Like, you get new services



`541 00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,100`
and new API calls every day.



`542 00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,260`
And like, of course they test it,



`543 00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,940`
but we don't have enough people,



`544 00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,200`
like security people,



`545 00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,780`
like going at all these new services



`546 00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,980`
because every day I wake up,



`547 00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,180`
I go to the AWS console,



`548 00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,860`
something new thing pops up.



`549 00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,200`
I see a version 2.3.2



`550 00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,980`
of a new API call for something



`551 00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,380`
with another, like another field, you know?



`552 00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,380`
What happens if you fuzz that field?



`553 00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,860`
Does anyone test it?



`554 00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:11,160`
Nope.



`555 00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:12,600`
Why not?



`556 00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:13,980`
It takes time, exactly.



`557 00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,600`
So I feel that getting to the cloud,



`558 00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,120`
and we showed you like three ways of doing that



`559 00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:19,920`
and the easiest way,



`560 00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,580`
like a deserialization attack,



`561 00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,840`
which has been available for years.



`562 00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,360`
But once I got into the cloud



`563 00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,540`
and then he started attacking the ADFS proxy



`564 00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,260`
and we tunneled into the internal,



`565 00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:31,560`
I mean, that is something



`566 00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,060`
that I don't think anyone's prepared for.



`567 00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,680`
I don't think anyone's prepared



`568 00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,440`
for someone coming from their cloud



`569 00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,260`
into the internal.



`570 00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,700`
It's sort of a thing now, isn't it?



`571 00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,280`
Like, in the before times,



`572 00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,200`
we talked,



`573 00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,040`
we talked about an inside



`574 00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,700`
and an outside of the corporate network.



`575 00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:45,820`
And then we sort of evolved



`576 00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:48,200`
deploying zone concepts, right?



`577 00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,260`
We have different zones,



`578 00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,240`
like EMZs and whatnot.



`579 00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,700`
And then we invented the cloud.



`580 00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,460`
And then we sort of reinvented



`581 00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,840`
the inside-outside again.



`582 00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:59,140`
But with the same problematic image



`583 00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:02,340`
with corporates and networks



`584 00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,880`
that needs to be interconnected in a way.



`585 00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,540`
So we sort of created



`586 00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,960`
a more complex environment,



`587 00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:07,800`
one could say, right?



`588 00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,260`
And that's, I think your talk



`589 00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,200`
sort of sums that up pretty nicely.



`590 00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,200`
Like, we have internal stuff,



`591 00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,240`
but it's more or less reachable



`592 00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,840`
from public clouds.



`593 00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:18,220`
Yeah.



`594 00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,980`
There's a false impression



`595 00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,460`
of security with the cloud



`596 00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,200`
where people think that



`597 00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,220`
their assets in the cloud



`598 00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,200`
are completely isolated



`599 00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,600`
from the internal,



`600 00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,420`
which we just demonstrated.



`601 00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,840`
No, it's not.



`602 00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,100`
And they also think



`603 00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,300`
when they run an EC2 instance



`604 00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,400`
that it's protected.



`605 00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,180`
But once there's a patch out,



`606 00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,260`
there's like a vulnerability.



`607 00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,000`
It's your responsibility



`608 00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,600`
to patch it



`609 00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,740`
if you don't use a managed service.



`610 00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,780`
In the shared model,



`611 00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,060`
you're responsible for this.



`612 00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,560`
And I was emphasizing



`613 00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,240`
how, I mean,



`614 00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,640`
AWS lets you do patching



`615 00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,460`
in like one click,



`616 00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,220`
patching everything.



`617 00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,320`
But I was emphasizing



`618 00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,280`
how I think patching



`619 00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,500`
is the wrong way to do this.



`620 00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:55,700`
Yeah.



`621 00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,780`
Because we're running in VMs.



`622 00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,200`
Like, getting a new image



`623 00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,300`
on a VM is fast.



`624 00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,520`
It's not like restarting



`625 00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,120`
100 computers, right?



`626 00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,200`
VMs are fast.



`627 00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,260`
If you're using like Docker,



`628 00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,360`
it's even faster.



`629 00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,240`
You get like 30 minutes



`630 00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:08,760`
startup time.



`631 00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,200`
So just get a new base image,



`632 00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,400`
put a patch in there



`633 00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,020`
and then replace everything



`634 00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:14,700`
so you know that



`635 00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,920`
everything is running on your own.



`636 00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,860`
But it depends on



`637 00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:17,860`
what service you're running.



`638 00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,640`
If you are like this



`639 00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,500`
hip young company



`640 00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,100`
or like a,



`641 00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:20,980`
not young,



`642 00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,040`
like you developed



`643 00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,640`
DevOps pipeline.



`644 00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,700`
So you have everything.



`645 00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,220`
You have scriptable infrastructure.



`646 00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,480`
You have a build service.



`647 00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,620`
Like you have CircleCI.



`648 00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,420`
You have something



`649 00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,220`
that deploys code.



`650 00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,640`
Then I think it will make sense.



`651 00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,720`
But you have a lot



`652 00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,900`
of big enterprises there



`653 00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,880`
running like fat and thick



`654 00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,000`
client-driven Java.



`655 00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,280`
Yeah, running Bespoke.



`656 00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,420`
Yeah, they can run them.



`657 00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,180`
Yeah, all right.



`658 00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,280`
Let's say they're running



`659 00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,060`
a monolith, right?



`660 00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,080`
But then they're running



`661 00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:44,620`
on a machine.



`662 00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,520`
That machine has



`663 00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,300`
an Amazon machine image



`664 00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,280`
that it's running on, right?



`665 00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:48,760`
Yeah, sure.



`666 00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,760`
But then it will be harder



`667 00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,980`
to define a Docker image



`668 00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:52,920`
and be harder to...



`669 00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,800`
No, I'm not talking about Docker.



`670 00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,480`
I'm talking about



`671 00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,500`
operating system.



`672 00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,300`
You get the Linux.



`673 00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:57,980`
You harden it



`674 00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:58,840`
with one of those.



`675 00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,460`
There's a bunch of



`676 00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,260`
Ansible scripts that harden it.



`677 00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,040`
Oh yeah, you can even have it



`678 00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,680`
as your private AMI or something.



`679 00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,600`
Yeah, what I'm saying is



`680 00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,820`
you bake your own AMIs.



`681 00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,340`
Every time there's a vulnerability,



`682 00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,500`
you don't patch



`683 00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,920`
an existing machine.



`684 00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,640`
You bake a new AMI



`685 00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,180`
that is built in.



`686 00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,020`
Oh, that makes sense.



`687 00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:12,980`
And you swap it, right?



`688 00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,780`
You can have your monolith,



`689 00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,480`
double monolith.



`690 00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,700`
At some time,



`691 00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:17,500`
you just swap them.



`692 00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,340`
And that will be...



`693 00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,120`
That way you know



`694 00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,560`
that patches might fail.



`695 00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,360`
And then you have to manage that.



`696 00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,860`
But once you bake an AMI



`697 00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,400`
and it works



`698 00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,920`
and you just swap it



`699 00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,620`
on all your machines



`700 00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,060`
and it's a super easy process



`701 00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:29,680`
with Packer.



`702 00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:30,300`
It makes sense.



`703 00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,980`
But a lot like kernel hardening



`704 00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:32,740`
if you run Linux



`705 00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,180`
is really important.



`706 00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,460`
Like removing all the



`707 00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,660`
bad file permissions



`708 00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,460`
that might exist.



`709 00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,620`
So that makes sense.



`710 00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,580`
And have your base image.



`711 00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,180`
Do it that way.



`712 00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,500`
Runs and then roll everything on.



`713 00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,300`
And you have tools for that.



`714 00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:44,940`
So HashiCorp,



`715 00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:45,620`
they have Packer



`716 00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,180`
which gives you a stager.



`717 00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,020`
It takes...



`718 00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,960`
You take like the base



`719 00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,220`
Ubuntu image



`720 00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,140`
by AWS.



`721 00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,720`
It runs it on machine



`722 00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,780`
and then you give it



`723 00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,500`
a bunch of stages



`724 00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,260`
that you want to do.



`725 00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,860`
So I put Ansible scripts



`726 00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,180`
to harden the kernel.



`727 00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:00,580`
Yeah.



`728 00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,060`
Right?



`729 00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,020`
You have...



`730 00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,020`
And so CTL



`731 00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,140`
and maybe you do



`732 00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,480`
your Chromeworks



`733 00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,200`
and you do



`734 00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,080`
file system permissions.



`735 00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:07,580`
Exactly.



`736 00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,380`
You can do custom scripts.



`737 00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,580`
You can do Ansible.



`738 00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,160`
You can do



`739 00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:11,500`
Chef.



`740 00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,540`
But HashiCorp is actually...



`741 00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,820`
They're doing good stuff.



`742 00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:14,780`
They're doing good stuff.



`743 00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:15,880`
Vault is a really good product



`744 00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,520`
in conjunction with KMS



`745 00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,420`
or Parameter Store



`746 00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:18,780`
or something.



`747 00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,080`
Yeah.



`748 00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,160`
So you unseal it with KMS.



`749 00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:21,440`
Yeah.



`750 00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,840`
That's the way you should do.



`751 00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:23,940`
But again,



`752 00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:24,860`
also you have



`753 00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,680`
things in HashiCorp



`754 00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,920`
that I don't like



`755 00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,160`
that they give you



`756 00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:29,960`
the easiness.



`757 00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,120`
So if you're on console



`758 00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,100`
and you want to do



`759 00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:33,680`
server discovery,



`760 00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:34,940`
they can give you



`761 00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,660`
the EC2 server discovery.



`762 00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,280`
That means you have to give



`763 00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,480`
describe tags



`764 00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,380`
and describe instances



`765 00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:40,920`
to each server.



`766 00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:40,980`
Yeah.



`767 00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:41,000`
Yeah.



`768 00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,100`
Yeah.



`769 00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:41,120`
Yeah.



`770 00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,140`
Yeah.



`771 00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,960`
If you give that



`772 00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,440`
an attacker



`773 00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,780`
gets in one of your instances,



`774 00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:45,740`
describe instances



`775 00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:46,500`
lets you read



`776 00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,700`
all the user data



`777 00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,160`
which can contain



`778 00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,020`
a lot of stuff.



`779 00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:51,200`
Yeah.



`780 00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,280`
So this is like



`781 00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,500`
the easiness they give you.



`782 00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:53,680`
Yeah.



`783 00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,540`
But it comes with



`784 00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,300`
a great risk



`785 00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,260`
that they don't specify



`786 00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:57,800`
in the documentation.



`787 00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,340`
But it's the same



`788 00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,640`
with versioning and indexing



`789 00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,320`
if you're storing



`790 00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,520`
your Terraform state files.



`791 00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:01,980`
Yeah.



`792 00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,340`
In an unsecure matter



`793 00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,060`
you will have



`794 00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,000`
more or less console output.



`795 00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:05,880`
You will have everything



`796 00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,800`
that that Terraforming script did.



`797 00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:08,640`
True.



`798 00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:08,960`
Yeah.



`799 00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,400`
So that's an important thing



`800 00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,120`
to really take care



`801 00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:11,760`
of as well.



`802 00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:11,860`
Exactly.



`803 00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,480`
It's those little things.



`804 00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:13,680`
Yeah.



`805 00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,340`
But the problem for me



`806 00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:15,840`
is they give you



`807 00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,960`
the easiness to do it.



`808 00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:17,100`
Yeah.



`809 00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:17,900`
Because to do it



`810 00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:18,880`
without doing



`811 00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,800`
the auto discover



`812 00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,580`
with EC2



`813 00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,660`
is a pain in the ass.



`814 00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:21,820`
Yeah.



`815 00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,260`
It's harder.



`816 00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,820`
But if you do it



`817 00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:24,080`
It's doable



`818 00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:24,840`
but it's harder.



`819 00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,360`
It's doable



`820 00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,580`
but when you have



`821 00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:27,160`
the EC2



`822 00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,020`
when someone compromises



`823 00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:28,380`
the machine



`824 00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,080`
and he can read



`825 00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:29,800`
all the user data



`826 00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,640`
from all your machines



`827 00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,180`
he will find something.



`828 00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:32,500`
Yeah.



`829 00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,380`
Most definitely.



`830 00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:33,700`
Yeah.



`831 00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,140`
So I think



`832 00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:35,560`
the easiness



`833 00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,100`
comes with a big risk



`834 00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,780`
and you shouldn't



`835 00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:39,800`
always read



`836 00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,060`
the production hardening guides



`837 00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:41,800`
because they're always



`838 00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,520`
at the end



`839 00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,380`
at some point.



`840 00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:43,840`
But you need



`841 00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,580`
a maturity level



`842 00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,080`
to do that



`843 00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,820`
as well as your components



`844 00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,600`
like fixing SMB



`845 00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,060`
like relay attacks.



`846 00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:52,120`
Like yeah



`847 00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:52,840`
we patched



`848 00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,520`
a lot of stuff



`849 00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,360`
but as you said



`850 00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,080`
some of the patches



`851 00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,080`
were incomplete, right?



`852 00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:56,480`
Right.



`853 00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,360`
But we still



`854 00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,520`
in my opinion



`855 00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,720`
you have to correct me



`856 00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,140`
if I'm wrong



`857 00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:00,820`
but there's still



`858 00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:01,840`
a lot of companies



`859 00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,540`
out there running



`860 00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,220`
SMB 1.0



`861 00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:04,500`
and



`862 00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,540`
I was going to say



`863 00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,160`
it's enough



`864 00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,040`
to have one



`865 00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:07,880`
old server



`866 00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,380`
in an AD environment



`867 00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,520`
and you're basically



`868 00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,980`
throwing around



`869 00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,260`
NTLM hashes.



`870 00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,400`
All I need is one.



`871 00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,060`
Yeah, right?



`872 00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:15,940`
The guy from Pre-Em.



`873 00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:16,540`
What did he say?



`874 00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,300`
The version 1 of



`875 00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:17,780`
what was it?



`876 00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,540`
He says like



`877 00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,880`
stop it if you're running that.



`878 00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,600`
Of net NTLM.



`879 00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:22,860`
Yeah.



`880 00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,000`
And people are still



`881 00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,280`
running it.



`882 00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,820`
If you run



`883 00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,580`
Mimikatz



`884 00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,280`
you almost always



`885 00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,100`
find a digest



`886 00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,080`
password



`887 00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,160`
even now.



`888 00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:32,800`
Yeah.



`889 00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,080`
So I mean



`890 00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:34,640`
the thing is



`891 00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,300`
is the whole



`892 00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,580`
like in our talk



`893 00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,380`
I showed how



`894 00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,200`
I was able to get



`895 00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,040`
60 shells



`896 00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:40,860`
in 30 seconds



`897 00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,580`
but the reality



`898 00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,220`
of the situation



`899 00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,740`
is I just need one.



`900 00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:45,160`
Yeah.



`901 00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,680`
In an Active Directory



`902 00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,140`
environment



`903 00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,200`
I just need one shell



`904 00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,060`
and the rest



`905 00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:49,760`
is all going to



`906 00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,020`
it's a domino effect.



`907 00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:51,640`
Yeah.



`908 00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,360`
Yeah.



`909 00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,280`
Absolutely.



`910 00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:54,820`
And I mean



`911 00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,200`
that's



`912 00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,220`
that's your



`913 00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,580`
that's the trade-off



`914 00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,040`
that you have



`915 00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:58,820`
with Active Directory



`916 00:27:58,820 --> 00:27:59,160`
right?



`917 00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,400`
You have that convenience



`918 00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,020`
but in the event



`919 00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,020`
that it's compromised



`920 00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,780`
then it's all



`921 00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:05,680`
going to eventually



`922 00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:05,980`
go down.



`923 00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:06,460`
It's game over.



`924 00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,480`
And it's sort of like



`925 00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,100`
you don't even



`926 00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,160`
have to have



`927 00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:09,640`
like really



`928 00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,700`
nice credentials



`929 00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,060`
anyway



`930 00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:11,680`
because it is



`931 00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,500`
it's based



`932 00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,740`
out of reading attributes.



`933 00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,120`
So every user



`934 00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:16,820`
needs to be able



`935 00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,220`
to read



`936 00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,100`
the Active Directory



`937 00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,200`
database, right?



`938 00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,240`
So you know



`939 00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:20,940`
where to look.



`940 00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:21,860`
So if you compromise



`941 00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:22,440`
one machine



`942 00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,760`
you have all the access



`943 00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,040`
to actually know



`944 00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:25,980`
where to look next.



`945 00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:26,540`
Absolutely.



`946 00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,220`
And that's really



`947 00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,220`
the neat part.



`948 00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:28,800`
Absolutely.



`949 00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:29,400`
So yeah,



`950 00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,240`
it's a fun field.



`951 00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:30,960`
The neat part



`952 00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,780`
for the red team, yeah.



`953 00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:32,400`
Yeah, yeah.



`954 00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:33,780`
And also



`955 00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:34,800`
there's the problem



`956 00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,240`
that you know



`957 00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,180`
like he showed you



`958 00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:36,640`
all that stuff



`959 00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,860`
on internals



`960 00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:38,820`
and there's a bunch



`961 00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,380`
of companies



`962 00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,520`
doing internal pen tests



`963 00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,500`
web pen tests.



`964 00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,940`
I have not seen



`965 00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:44,920`
that many companies



`966 00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,560`
doing like AWS pen tests.



`967 00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:46,980`
Right.



`968 00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:47,600`
You know,



`969 00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:48,500`
there's Rhino Labs.



`970 00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,280`
Rhino do it.



`971 00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,080`
Our company



`972 00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:50,660`
where I work



`973 00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,780`
I do a lot of them



`974 00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,120`
every week almost.



`975 00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,020`
But compare that



`976 00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:54,800`
to like internal



`977 00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,980`
web applications.



`978 00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:58,920`
Because of that



`979 00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,640`
even the amount



`980 00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,180`
of research



`981 00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,340`
we have on vulnerabilities



`982 00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,480`
is low



`983 00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,520`
because if you have



`984 00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,280`
like three companies



`985 00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,000`
or like let's say



`986 00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,820`
I'm going to go



`987 00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:06,620`
like 50 companies



`988 00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,080`
in the world



`989 00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,040`
versus like thousands



`990 00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:08,560`
doing that



`991 00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,280`
and like



`992 00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:09,720`
preempt



`993 00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,840`
I don't think



`994 00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,900`
they're probably



`995 00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,300`
doing internal, right?



`996 00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,480`
I mean most of the research



`997 00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,340`
is about AD



`998 00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:17,660`
or they have a product



`999 00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,980`
but you don't have



`1000 00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:19,500`
that in the cloud



`1001 00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,500`
so the amount of research



`1002 00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,040`
the amount of like



`1003 00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,400`
manpower and hours



`1004 00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,180`
that go into it.



`1005 00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:23,800`
But we're getting



`1006 00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,520`
a lot of like



`1007 00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,380`
AVS



`1008 00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,560`
more or less



`1009 00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,080`
implemented



`1010 00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,240`
security features



`1011 00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,300`
like Aqua security



`1012 00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,080`
does a lot of



`1013 00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,440`
AMIs that you can



`1014 00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,120`
install directly



`1015 00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:32,780`
into the cloud.



`1016 00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,340`
Those are the



`1017 00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,240`
Docker scanning.



`1018 00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:35,480`
You have



`1019 00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,300`
Falco and Systic



`1020 00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:37,860`
they are maybe



`1021 00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,780`
not the best



`1022 00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,240`
but they're



`1023 00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,160`
Falco and Systic



`1024 00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,460`
so it's like



`1025 00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:45,380`
well it's not like



`1026 00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,960`
it's sort of



`1027 00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,120`
it's anomaly detection



`1028 00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:49,780`
more or less



`1029 00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,020`
we can talk a little bit



`1030 00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:51,620`
more about that



`1031 00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:52,240`
off camera



`1032 00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,080`
but they're



`1033 00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,000`
really



`1034 00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000`
they've just been



`1035 00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,080`
accepted into the



`1036 00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:56,960`
CNF



`1037 00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,960`
the native foundation



`1038 00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,160`
and they are



`1039 00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,500`
they will be good



`1040 00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,020`
eventually



`1041 00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,240`
but not



`1042 00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,700`
really mature yet.



`1043 00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,520`
I have a little bit



`1044 00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:05,880`
of problem



`1045 00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,440`
with the cloud



`1046 00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,400`
native foundation



`1047 00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,020`
it's not a big



`1048 00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:09,380`
problem



`1049 00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,240`
I'm just saying



`1050 00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,780`
the acceptance rate



`1051 00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,400`
right



`1052 00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,000`
you go look



`1053 00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:14,540`
at the landscape



`1054 00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,980`
for every



`1055 00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:16,920`
like cubicle there



`1056 00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,660`
you have like



`1057 00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,440`
50 solutions



`1058 00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,220`
and when you have



`1059 00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:20,520`
that



`1060 00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,800`
there's 50 solutions



`1061 00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,140`
with 50



`1062 00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,560`
different places



`1063 00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:24,900`
to look for



`1064 00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:25,540`
new vulnerabilities



`1065 00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,300`
because people



`1066 00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:26,860`
are running that



`1067 00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:27,360`
right



`1068 00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,340`
once you kind of



`1069 00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:28,700`
like



`1070 00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,100`
get closer



`1071 00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:30,540`
and like



`1072 00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,100`
that's why I like



`1073 00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:31,520`
console



`1074 00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,020`
or like



`1075 00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:32,340`
so you have



`1076 00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:32,740`
console



`1077 00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,280`
Istio



`1078 00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:33,660`
and like



`1079 00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:33,960`
LinkedIn



`1080 00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,320`
right



`1081 00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:34,880`
they're like



`1082 00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,560`
the most



`1083 00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,520`
most people



`1084 00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,160`
are running them



`1085 00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:37,840`
so



`1086 00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,320`
so



`1087 00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,040`
you can test



`1088 00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:40,400`
these



`1089 00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,240`
and you'll find



`1090 00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,040`
like the vulnerabilities



`1091 00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:42,600`
and fix them



`1092 00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,440`
but once you have



`1093 00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:43,720`
like



`1094 00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,800`
a hundred



`1095 00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,320`
like



`1096 00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:45,900`
microservice



`1097 00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:46,460`
proxies



`1098 00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,180`
it's very hard



`1099 00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:48,480`
to like



`1100 00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,120`
look for things



`1101 00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,040`
in every one of them



`1102 00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,100`
the world of



`1103 00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:51,480`
Kubernetes



`1104 00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,360`
and orchestrations



`1105 00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,640`
are at their door



`1106 00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,320`
and it's getting



`1107 00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:54,700`
adopted



`1108 00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,760`
in a rate



`1109 00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,200`
that we



`1110 00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:56,700`
can't even



`1111 00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,060`
comprehend



`1112 00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:57,600`
so



`1113 00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,620`
well



`1114 00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:59,340`
I think



`1115 00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,100`
we will not



`1116 00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:00,820`
be out of a job



`1117 00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:01,300`
soon



`1118 00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:01,820`
oh yeah



`1119 00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:02,420`
like



`1120 00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,580`
the more there is



`1121 00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:04,160`
the more I'm



`1122 00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,020`
gonna look for things



`1123 00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:05,240`
right



`1124 00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:05,920`
either console



`1125 00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,420`
my next



`1126 00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,180`
will be Istio



`1127 00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:07,700`
I'll look for



`1128 00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,140`
how to



`1129 00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:08,780`
break that



`1130 00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:09,140`
and



`1131 00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,040`
like



`1132 00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:10,860`
you know



`1133 00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:11,320`
every day



`1134 00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:11,640`
something new



`1135 00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,440`
thing comes out



`1136 00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:12,860`
and



`1137 00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,500`
I'm a developer



`1138 00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,520`
so



`1139 00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,440`
I know that



`1140 00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:16,840`
I make



`1141 00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,320`
vulnerability



`1142 00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:17,820`
in my code



`1143 00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:18,580`
so



`1144 00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,380`
and people



`1145 00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:19,640`
found



`1146 00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:19,960`
vulnerability



`1147 00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,580`
in my code



`1148 00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,160`
and



`1149 00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:21,820`
it's fine



`1150 00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:22,260`
it's like



`1151 00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:22,640`
no one's



`1152 00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:22,940`
perfect



`1153 00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:23,860`
I think



`1154 00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:24,760`
you know



`1155 00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,460`
people are more



`1156 00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,400`
concerned about



`1157 00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,180`
preventing



`1158 00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:27,840`
that



`1159 00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,020`
initial point



`1160 00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:29,640`
of compromise



`1161 00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,540`
but



`1162 00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,520`
there's really



`1163 00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,260`
nothing you can



`1164 00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,040`
do about that



`1165 00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:33,740`
it's inevitable



`1166 00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:34,700`
I think



`1167 00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,300`
what's very



`1168 00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:35,840`
important



`1169 00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,800`
and highly



`1170 00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,220`
like



`1171 00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,120`
underestimate



`1172 00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:38,600`
it



`1173 00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,120`
as far as



`1174 00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:39,620`
the amount



`1175 00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,040`
of value



`1176 00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:40,340`
that it



`1177 00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:40,680`
offers



`1178 00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,680`
is having



`1179 00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,500`
telemetry



`1180 00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,260`
like



`1181 00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,160`
you know



`1182 00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:44,820`
like



`1183 00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:45,200`
for my



`1184 00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:45,700`
particular



`1185 00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,100`
attack



`1186 00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:46,400`
that I



`1187 00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:46,920`
demonstrated



`1188 00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,140`
yes



`1189 00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:48,560`
I use



`1190 00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,280`
an undetectable



`1191 00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:49,700`
payload



`1192 00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,100`
you were



`1193 00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:50,580`
not able



`1194 00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:50,860`
to see



`1195 00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:51,440`
the traffic



`1196 00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,500`
you weren't



`1197 00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:52,960`
able to



`1198 00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,460`
see



`1199 00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,980`
anything



`1200 00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:55,280`
going



`1201 00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:55,580`
across



`1202 00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,060`
the wire



`1203 00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:56,900`
but



`1204 00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,040`
why



`1205 00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:58,280`
were



`1206 00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:58,520`

simultaneously



`1213 00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,160`
that's



`1214 00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:04,600`
the thing



`1215 00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,200`
you need



`1216 00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:05,540`
to have



`1217 00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:05,860`

`1223 00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,800`
it's

you



`1249 00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:23,340`
don't

even

you

should



`1261 00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,140`
yeah



`1262 00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:27,360`
so



`1263 00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:27,560`
you



`1264 00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:27,760`
don't

`1329 00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,120`
yeah



`1330 00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,320`
that's

`1341 00:32:59,040 --> 00:32:59,400`

you



`1350 00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:02,980`
