## AI transkribering

_AI försöker förstå oss... Ha överseende med galna feltranskriberingar._

`1 00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840`
Okej, så vi sitter här tillsammans med Edvin van Andel från Zerocopter som kommer ut på scenen.



`2 00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,760`
Det här är Säkerhetsbordkastning och transmittning från Säkti 2021.



`3 00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:16,280`
Det är en stor glädje att ha dig här och sitta tillsammans med min äldre kollega Peter.



`4 00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:22,520`
Ja, tack. Det var start-up-säsongen från Säkti den här åren.



`5 00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,800`
Den här åren och den senaste åren, så det här är en tvåårig start-up.



`6 00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,520`
Så det är en tuff kraft, men jag tror att du lyckades lägga dem till en bra start.



`7 00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,840`
Tack för att du gjorde det.



`8 00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,120`
Jag hoppas alltid att mina tal är lite roliga på en sida,



`9 00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,600`
för att få publiken att vara interaktiv och attraktiv och så vidare.



`10 00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:46,000`
Men när de går bort, så har de något som de säger att de kanske måste förändra.



`11 00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,200`
Det är i princip idén med mina tal.



`12 00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,120`
Ja, och jag tror att du hade några riktigt goda berättelser för att börja ta upp de här tankarna.



`13 00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:55,600`
Ja.



`14 00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:02,240`
Jag menar, beroende på de buggar som kommer över och över igen, som du säger.



`15 00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:08,520`
Men som jag förstår, så är du en del av en volubilderingsförslagssättning i Nederländerna, eller hur?



`16 00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,040`
Ja, korrekt. Vi arbetar utanför regeringen, alltså inte regeringen.



`17 00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,360`
Så vi får göra lite mer än regeringen kan göra.



`18 00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,720`
Och vi försöker hålla Nederländerna lite säkra.



`19 00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,040`
Så vi skannar och vi försöker hjälpa barn som kanske går åt fel väg.



`20 00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,600`
Till exempel hade vi en barn senast.



`21 00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:35,080`
Han hittade en databas med mycket kreditkartinformering och han pratar med det om sina vänner, men han vet att han inte kan använda det för att han kommer att bli använd.



`22 00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:39,960`
Och sen kommer en kriminal och offrar honom ungefär 3 000 eller 4 000 euro för att köpa databasen.



`23 00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:48,560`
Och innan han vet, så är han i kriminalorganisationen och vi försöker som grumpiga gamla hackare, de äldre de är, att säga okej, inte göra det.



`24 00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,160`
Bara avslöja det till företaget, vi kommer att hjälpa dig, vi gör säkerhet att du inte blir använd.



`25 00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,440`
Men du blir i princip berömd för hjälp.



`26 00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,360`
Vi hjälper företaget att bli bättre och det är i princip idéen som vi försöker hålla ut i Nederländerna.



`27 00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:07,880`
Så det är lite om att hitta ungdomar innan barnet är helt utvecklat?



`28 00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,160`
Ja, det är korrekt.



`29 00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,440`
Och vi arbetar även med norska polisen.



`30 00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:23,120`
De har ett program som heter HackRide, där om någon är använd under 21 år för deras första cyberkrimsrelaterade incident, så är de inte ställda i krig, utan skickade till oss.



`31 00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:38,600`
Och vi lär dem och visar dem hur man kan vara ansvarig för utsläpp, och vi hittar på dem lite, men vi försöker att få dem att vara rädda, att inte göra det, att försöka hjälpa världen att bli bättre, och det fungerar, så det är väldigt fint.



`32 00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:49,080`
Det är ett fantastiskt utsläpp, det är kanske något som andra länder borde hitta också, att hitta dem och hjälpa dem att komma på väg, som ett korrektionsinstitut, men på rätt sätt.



`33 00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,080`
Ja, men det är också logiskt.



`34 00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,480`
I Nederländerna till exempel.



`35 00:02:52,480 --> 00:03:08,560`
Om du skickar något ur en skärm, så blir dina föräldrar rädda, kanske polisen, stadspolisen blir rädd, skärmföreningen blir rädd, skolan ger dig en lektion, så du har fyra eller fem olika människor som ställer dig.



`36 00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:16,080`
Och om du är i ditt rum och du inte har föräldrar som tittar över dig eller vad det är, så är du fri, du blir inte korrekt.



`37 00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:22,240`
Och jag tror att det är lite nödvändigt, och föräldrarna frågar mig alltid, vad kan jag göra, min barn är alltid uppe på väggen.



`38 00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:28,880`
Ska jag installera all den här softwaren för att monitorera honom, och jag säger att om han är en bra hackare, så spelar det ingen roll, för han kommer att bypassa det.



`39 00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,520`
Det bästa du kan göra är att lära dem etik.



`40 00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:44,160`
Så berätta till dem att det är okej om du hittar något, det är okej om du vill hacka, men om du gör det, så rapportera det till företaget, var en bra person, gör det etiskt, och så är du även känd i samhället.



`41 00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,160`
Och du blir inte räddad, du måste inte titta över hjärtat. Det är det enda du kan göra.



`42 00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,120`
Jag vet att en av våra podcastkollegor är en del av det här.



`43 00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,120`
Jag vet att en av våra podcastkollegor är en del av det här.



`44 00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,120`
Jag vet att en av våra podcastkollegor är en del av det här.



`45 00:03:52,120 --> 00:04:01,860`
Och det här är en del Growthrack, de gör en videor som kommer till Swedish Television från Sverige, hvor de läst lite om det här.



`46 00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,360`
Och det här är en del av det här.



`47 00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,360`
Och det här är en del av det här.



`48 00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,360`
Och det här är en del av det här.



`49 00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,440`
Och det här är en del av det här.



`50 00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,620`
Och det här är en del av det här.



`51 00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:19,800`
Så jag är lite trött



`52 00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,360`
Och det här är en del av det här.



`53 00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,060`
och det här är en del av det här.



`54 00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:21,500`
Och det här är en del av det här.



`55 00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:21,860`
Och det här är en del av det här.



`56 00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,000`
Och det här är en del av det här.



`57 00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,100`
Och det här är en del av det här.



`58 00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:22,120`
Och det här är en del av det här.



`59 00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,160`
av oss, vi kanske vet



`60 00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,940`
om IT-säkerhet och



`61 00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,160`
IT-säkerhet-relaterade



`62 00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,500`
moral-dilemmar, men



`63 00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,800`
jag tror att om vi



`64 00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,980`
väljer en generik förälder, så kanske



`65 00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,260`
de inte är familiar med



`66 00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,860`
IT-säkerhet och krimer och



`67 00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,980`
sådana saker. Ja, det är rätt. Och också



`68 00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,000`
barnen själva, de ser det som en spel.



`69 00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,740`
Du vet, de spelar spel



`70 00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,980`
och de kan göra något, och sen finns det internet



`71 00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,980`
som också är på skärmen, så du kan göra



`72 00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,040`
något, och det är där det går fel.



`73 00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,220`
And I would suggest



`74 00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,040`
trying to educate the parents



`75 00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,220`
and not so much all the technical



`76 00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,960`
stuff, but more on the moral



`77 00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,260`
side, the ethical side.



`78 00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,080`
Try to do the same thing as



`79 00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,740`
you would do in normal life.



`80 00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,060`
If you find somebody's keys outside the



`81 00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,240`
door, don't steal them, but ring the door



`82 00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,060`
and give



`83 00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,220`
them back. And if you do that on the internet



`84 00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,080`
in the same way, then it's all fine.



`85 00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,820`
But you also need to educate the



`86 00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,840`
companies, right? Oh, yes.



`87 00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,780`
I mean, because they will freak out



`88 00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,900`
someone telling you, oh, we have a



`89 00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,280`
vulnerability, and okay, we'll



`90 00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,000`
pin you down, right? So the vulnerability disclosure



`91 00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,900`
setup needs to



`92 00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,300`
be taught also to the



`93 00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,200`
kids at the companies.



`94 00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,880`
Yeah, well, that's true. We have



`95 00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,820`
a lot of companies that come to us and



`96 00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,780`
want to join, and if we ask



`97 00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,800`
them about what is your current status



`98 00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,820`
in security, and they haven't done anything,



`99 00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,340`
we don't accept them as a client,



`100 00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,800`
because it's unworkable. You have to



`101 00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,880`
have processes in place, and what we



`102 00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,760`
do is we filter in between, so that



`103 00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,840`
means that you don't get all the bullshit, but



`104 00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,920`
only the serious things go to the company,



`105 00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,640`
but still, you have to



`106 00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,400`
discuss with the researcher,



`107 00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,860`
because they want it to know they're proud of



`108 00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,620`
what they found, so they want interaction



`109 00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,780`
with you. And if you can do that, and



`110 00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,880`
if you can also fix it within, like, say



`111 00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,880`
60 or 90 days, according



`112 00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,440`
to standards, then it's fine.



`113 00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,640`
But you have to have that process in place.



`114 00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,020`
If you don't, then, yeah, you get a lot of



`115 00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,760`
miscommunication, and



`116 00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,500`
miscommunication leads to problems.



`117 00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,700`
So you could have, like, a group



`118 00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,600`
of hang-around companies that



`119 00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,780`
want to join the disclosure



`120 00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,800`
program, but they're not there yet.



`121 00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,580`
They're not there yet, no, and they have to be



`122 00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,820`
educated and taught, and often



`123 00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,660`
it's also within a company there are a few



`124 00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,200`
people who want to work with us,



`125 00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,660`
and then it goes up the chain, you know, it goes



`126 00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,600`
to procurement, and to legal,



`127 00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,720`
and to the board, and they say, hackers?



`128 00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,280`
No way\! You know?



`129 00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,620`
Yeah, but you're hacked already, you know, with



`130 00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,660`
just the same stuff as is happening



`131 00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,660`
already, only now you know it, instead



`132 00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,560`
of that it's criminally used,



`133 00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,560`
or whatever, but still, you know,



`134 00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,540`
and I think it's also the term



`135 00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,260`
hacker that's still too negative.



`136 00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,140`
I mean, if you look at the media,



`137 00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,520`
somebody hacked, a hacker did this,



`138 00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,640`
it's all bad, you know, and for us, hacking



`139 00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,540`
is our pride, you know, so



`140 00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,780`
it's always difficult. If a hacker



`141 00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,560`
would be positive, then I think



`142 00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,740`
the rest of the world will follow along



`143 00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,020`
a bit, I hope.



`144 00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,900`
So, talking about hacking and hackers,



`145 00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,660`
your name, Edwin,



`146 00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,740`
it comes



`147 00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,660`
up, some persons might



`148 00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,340`
have heard the Darknet Diary



`149 00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,180`
podcast, where you



`150 00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,520`
disclosed some details



`151 00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,660`
about the hacking of the Trump



`152 00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,160`
Twitter account, right?



`153 00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,680`
Well, it wasn't hacking. No, no, good



`154 00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,540`
guessing. Yeah, good guessing, yeah.



`155 00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,300`
No, not good guessing, there was,



`156 00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,400`
we were in Brukon, a conference



`157 00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,260`
in 2016, and



`158 00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,700`
the databases leak all



`159 00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,380`
the time, and people crack databases,



`160 00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,520`
and LinkedIn was hacked in 2012,



`161 00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,720`
and around that time



`162 00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,580`
the database came publicly available, so



`163 00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,140`
we looked at it, and we were just



`164 00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,680`
in our hotel room, because it came out



`165 00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,820`
that day, warning Dutch government officials



`166 00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,500`
like, your password is in here,



`167 00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,660`
and etc, etc, so please fix it,



`168 00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,780`
and then Trump was on TV,



`169 00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,660`
and then one of my colleagues said, oh,



`170 00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,840`
I wonder if he would be in there, and we looked,



`171 00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,720`
and he was in there with a password, which



`172 00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,780`
was like, okay, it's your TV



`173 00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,800`
show, it was your fire, you know?



`174 00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,800`
So, and I had a little



`175 00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,360`
bit too much beer,



`176 00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,200`
so I was at my laptop,



`177 00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,500`
and somebody said,



`178 00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,520`
I wonder if it would work on Twitter, and I



`179 00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,060`
just entered his account.



`180 00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,660`
So you were the one with the fingers at the keyboard, right?



`181 00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,460`
And I pressed enter, and it was,



`182 00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,640`
we weren't in yet, but we, yeah,



`183 00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,600`
the password was correct, so



`184 00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,380`
then it was like, uh-oh, you know?



`185 00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,620`
And it was two weeks before election, so



`186 00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,660`
what do we do? If we stop now,



`187 00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,600`
then, yeah, it all traces back to us,



`188 00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,800`
and what if somebody else already



`189 00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,620`
knows this, and now blames us



`190 00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,360`
for everything that might happen, so



`191 00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,660`
we went on, tried to get in fully,



`192 00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,140`
took screenshots,



`193 00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,460`
made timelines, and then did responsible



`194 00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,780`
disclosure to the Trump



`195 00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:55,420`
administration, and the American



`196 00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,620`
government, etc., and nobody



`197 00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,480`
responded, so then we tried



`198 00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,400`
the Dutch government, they have liaisons



`199 00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,080`
in the US, so they picked it up,



`200 00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,420`
and in the end, we got, like, two weeks



`201 00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,060`
later, like, it's fixed, and



`202 00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,240`
that was it. But we were scared



`203 00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,220`
to go to the US after that, because



`204 00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,400`
Trump isn't the most friendly guy.



`205 00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,340`
And you could easily become one



`206 00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,520`
of the persons that get randomly selected



`207 00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,260`
at the airport, right? Yeah, randomly selected,



`208 00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,040`
put in an orange jumpsuit, and



`209 00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,180`
bye, you know, so that was



`210 00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,260`
scared. But then there was a second time, right?



`211 00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,140`
Yeah, yeah. And there



`212 00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,360`
was a lot of doubt in the community



`213 00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,020`
whether it was really, like,



`214 00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,840`
fake news, or if it was actually



`215 00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,460`
a correct



`216 00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:37,320`
entry. I know it was correct



`217 00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,820`
because we did it, but



`218 00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,160`
it's also stupid that it happened



`219 00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,600`
the second time. But



`220 00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,100`
for us, the bigger problems were



`221 00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,080`
first of all, you should have had



`222 00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,160`
two-factor authentication, which was off



`223 00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,100`
again, probably because



`224 00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,060`
of the campaign team also using



`225 00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,160`
the same account. So that's why



`226 00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,200`
we put one password on it and leave



`227 00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,240`
it that way. But the biggest thing



`228 00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,300`
was that Twitter said that they couldn't



`229 00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,180`
find anything in their login. And



`230 00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,160`
that was something that the community



`231 00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,700`
said, oh, but then it's fake.



`232 00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,320`
But we, well,



`233 00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,340`
not heard officially, but



`234 00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,260`
the idea now is,



`235 00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,340`
let's put it that way, that Twitter



`236 00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,980`
wasn't allowed to



`237 00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,040`
log in on that account, because



`238 00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,980`
if you can see the location of the



`239 00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,900`
person, and you can see all the other



`240 00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,420`
things, so Twitter



`241 00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,860`
couldn't log it. So that's



`242 00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,780`
why they didn't see it. But the second



`243 00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:31,060`
time, was it basically the same thing



`244 00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,780`
or was it something different? It was



`245 00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,720`
the password was different.



`246 00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,260`
Exclamation mark, right?



`247 00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,920`
Well, no, it was a



`248 00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,220`
different password. It was



`249 00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,700`
make America great again, something, something,



`250 00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,800`
exclamation mark. And it was the



`251 00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,740`
same password which was used for the



`252 00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,780`
Wi-Fi, open Wi-Fi in the rallies.



`253 00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,100`
So, it was,



`254 00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,660`
yeah, it was way too easy again.



`255 00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,700`
But wasn't this also that you entered,



`256 00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,880`
like, you were logging in from



`257 00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,940`
a different IP address? Yeah. So you had



`258 00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,960`
to, like, a certain number? Yeah, we had to



`259 00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,940`
take a proxy in the US, close to



`260 00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,940`
where it was. That was one. And



`261 00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,440`
the email address validation



`262 00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,760`
had also, we also have to do,



`263 00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,040`
and it wasn't Trump, but it was



`264 00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,060`
Twitter at Trump.com or something.



`265 00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,940`
So it was very easy. But the



`266 00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,960`
problem was, if we wouldn't have done it



`267 00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,980`
and somebody else misused it, published



`268 00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,080`
all our DMs or whatever, then



`269 00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,180`
it might lead back to us. So that's



`270 00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,300`
why we had to go.



`271 00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,240`
Let's show, okay, we can really



`272 00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,240`
get in. We can really do anything.



`273 00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,100`
Here's all our proof, all our screenshots.



`274 00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,140`
These were the times that we did it.



`275 00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,400`
This was the IP address.



`276 00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,780`
Please fix this. Blah, blah, blah.



`277 00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,260`
But this is kind of a classic example



`278 00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,420`
of where



`279 00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:43,180`
it's not black and white.



`280 00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,320`
Like, you



`281 00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,440`
can't say this is



`282 00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,920`
100% fine, no issue at all.



`283 00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,680`
And you can't say



`284 00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:54,840`
this is really, really bad.



`285 00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,500`
This would be obviously criminal.



`286 00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,160`
Because when we go back



`287 00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,200`
to ethics discussion, which we had before,



`288 00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,120`
like, often



`289 00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,980`
things are



`290 00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:07,000`
gray. Yeah, they're gray.



`291 00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,260`
If nothing



`292 00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,420`
you are doing



`293 00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:13,280`
makes you ask



`294 00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,480`
any ethical questions,



`295 00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,000`
maybe either



`296 00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,960`
you're not doing



`297 00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,920`
anything interesting or you



`298 00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,940`
have a very weird sense of morals



`299 00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,600`
or ethics. It's true.



`300 00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,460`
But it's also true for our researchers



`301 00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,700`
because a lot of times clients have indeed



`302 00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,860`
scopes, but then sometimes you



`303 00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,700`
think, well, I think there's a problem



`304 00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,780`
here, but I have to go basically



`305 00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,980`
too far, but then I can show



`306 00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,940`
it to you. You know, what do you want?



`307 00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,960`
And with our clients, we can ask



`308 00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,760`
but in responsible



`309 00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,940`
disclosure or whatever, you basically can't ask.



`310 00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,900`
So then it's up to you. Are you going to



`311 00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,940`
do it? And then in the Netherlands, we have



`312 00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,000`
a law and all the



`313 00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,140`
judges have it. And it's basically



`314 00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,140`
said that if you break into a system



`315 00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,900`
and you can download all client



`316 00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,020`
data, don't do it. Just



`317 00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,040`
download two records to show that



`318 00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,120`
you can. So you are allowed to break



`319 00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,920`
in. You are allowed to download



`320 00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,980`
but only two records to



`321 00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,020`
show that you can. And then you won't



`322 00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,040`
get arrested. All the judges have



`323 00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,880`
that thing. And that's really awesome.



`324 00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,000`
So you say it's a law, like



`325 00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,880`
is it written in a law or is it...



`326 00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,920`
Is it a clarified practice from



`327 00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,000`
historical precedents? There is a law



`328 00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,040`
which says that responsible disclosure



`329 00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,160`
is allowed in the Netherlands.



`330 00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,060`
And all the judges have the rulings



`331 00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,400`
about it near their desk.



`332 00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,020`
So that basically means that if you do something



`333 00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,880`
in the Netherlands as a hacker and a company



`334 00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,960`
wants to sue you, then



`335 00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,980`
the judges looks at it and say if you



`336 00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,120`
apply to, you didn't publish



`337 00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,780`
it, you didn't download too much,



`338 00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,900`
you kept to all the rules, you announced



`339 00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,880`
it, you did blah, blah, blah, we're not



`340 00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,900`
going to prosecute. And that's



`341 00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,840`
awesome. Because it pushes companies



`342 00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,160`
to implement responsible



`343 00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,960`
disclosure. But going into that,



`344 00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,980`
if we look at the Kaseya situation that you



`345 00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,060`
also covered on your talk,



`346 00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,700`
there was findings, right?



`347 00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,020`
That were reported



`348 00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,560`
that was actually



`349 00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,580`
being used in the attack.



`350 00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:06,920`
Correct.



`351 00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:10,940`
So was it



`352 00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:13,200`
after the disclosure was out?



`353 00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,900`
No. So it was before this.



`354 00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,120`
So there could be ideas



`355 00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,780`
or conspiracies that



`356 00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,300`
someone has access to.



`357 00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,920`
Yeah, that's always the problem.



`358 00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,800`
But we see that also in our regular



`359 00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,060`
programs, that when something starts



`360 00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,940`
that a hacker finds something and three minutes



`361 00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,900`
later another one finds the same thing.



`362 00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,000`
So it's happened.



`363 00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,420`
It's not always



`364 00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,960`
obvious, but I think often



`365 00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,040`
you can see some sort



`366 00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,800`
of trends that if



`367 00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,340`
there's some new



`368 00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,960`
kind of



`369 00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,860`
entry point into thinking about



`370 00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,860`
security or one new



`371 00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,580`
kind of, it doesn't have to be



`372 00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,780`
like a new way of exploiting, but just



`373 00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,780`
some new way of getting to



`374 00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:55,360`
a problem.



`375 00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,520`
It seems like



`376 00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,760`
once there is some sort



`377 00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,280`
of breakthrough, then



`378 00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,740`
you will see independently



`379 00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,620`
very similar



`380 00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,880`
findings will grow out at different



`381 00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,400`
places.



`382 00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,960`
But that's the deal, right?



`383 00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,640`
With the Kaseya now. They managed



`384 00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,760`
to show that managed software



`385 00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,460`
or remote access software is



`386 00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,940`
a good way to get in because you have all the



`387 00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,460`
privilege. It's just



`388 00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:25,000`
open doors. So just



`389 00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,040`
go after those guys and you



`390 00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,420`
will be into everything.



`391 00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,920`
But that's the world. I mean, in the beginning



`392 00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,720`
all the hackers were focused on Windows,



`393 00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,040`
you know, because everybody had Windows



`394 00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,680`
so it's the most easy access point.



`395 00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,520`
Then Windows 10 got basically



`396 00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,820`
more secure. So what we're looking



`397 00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,880`
at now, what does everybody have



`398 00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,920`
besides Windows? Antivirus.



`399 00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,840`
So now all the hackers focus on



`400 00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,640`
antivirus because if you are in



`401 00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,220`
antivirus, you can access anything.



`402 00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,300`
And that will go on and on and on.



`403 00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,520`
And it's the same with this. I mean, first



`404 00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,560`
the companies were attacked. Now the companies get



`405 00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,760`
more and more secure. So now you go for the vendors



`406 00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,460`
which are used in the companies.



`407 00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,480`
And companies don't test it. I think



`408 00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,820`
if you want to do a true security



`409 00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,580`
test of are you vulnerable for



`410 00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,520`
this, give somebody, a pen



`411 00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,620`
tester, access to one computer



`412 00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,820`
in your network fully.



`413 00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,480`
Because that's what basically happens if you



`414 00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,380`
have like an air conditioning system and



`415 00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,340`
it's remotely managed. There's a computer



`416 00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,620`
in your network. And if that one



`417 00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,440`
is breached, then they can reach anything.



`418 00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,420`
And those tests are



`419 00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,400`
the next thing we should do. But yeah,



`420 00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,640`
you're always one step behind of



`421 00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,040`
criminals thinking.



`422 00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,420`
But it's also, I mean, if you



`423 00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,760`
lock down everything to the 100%



`424 00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,540`
security,



`425 00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,420`
we will go out of business because we couldn't



`426 00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,460`
work, right? Correct. And even



`427 00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,620`
then, 100% security can never be.



`428 00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,520`
No, exactly. No, I don't



`429 00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,100`
think so. So what's the next step?



`430 00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:48,260`
You're talking about supply chain as the



`431 00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,220`
thing that's going on for the last couple of years,



`432 00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,000`
right? Because you trust your vendors.



`433 00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,140`
You don't want to check them. You know how they're trustworthy



`434 00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,240`
and then you get in there. But what's



`435 00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,620`
the next step? Would you say the



`436 00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,360`
I mean, what's coming next after supply



`437 00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,120`
chain? Well,



`438 00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,240`
I just had a brilliant talk



`439 00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,280`
with a friend of mine about this and he says



`440 00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,780`
the next step is



`441 00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:10,180`
configuration issues. And I was



`442 00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,400`
like, hmm. And he said, yeah, everybody's building



`443 00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,420`
now systems which might be



`444 00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,240`
more secure, etc. You will



`445 00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,900`
still have bugs, but it doesn't matter.



`446 00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,220`
The problem now is configuration



`447 00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,220`
issues. And there have been research



`448 00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,220`
with some very advanced companies that



`449 00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,100`
did a scan of all their bugs and



`450 00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,060`
about 70% of all their



`451 00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,860`
bugs were configuration



`452 00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:32,120`
issues. So that means I have vendor A,



`453 00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,320`
I have vendor B, and I have vendor C



`454 00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,000`
and I have to combine them



`455 00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000`
and if I make one mistake, then



`456 00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,040`
somebody can misuse that. And



`457 00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,040`
he did some research and he said



`458 00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,160`
if you have a clear PC, so



`459 00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,700`
a new computer,



`460 00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,120`
and you install Windows on it, there



`461 00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,980`
is 10 to the time 600



`462 00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,180`
possibilities to configure Windows.



`463 00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,400`
So there might



`464 00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,360`
be one million mistakes in there.



`465 00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,220`
You don't know. And I think



`466 00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,980`
that will be,



`467 00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,300`
but not now because we're way too busy



`468 00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,580`
with still perimeters, with still



`469 00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,040`
client-sided



`470 00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,040`
tags, with still everything that's there,



`471 00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,200`
bug boundaries, etc. But I think in a couple



`472 00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,900`
of years you will see a shift to, okay,



`473 00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,060`
we got the basis of security



`474 00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,020`
fixed. What now? Well, the



`475 00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,140`
interaction thing, the configuration stuff,



`476 00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,820`
all that stuff, I think that will be



`477 00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,200`
the biggest thing in three to



`478 00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,100`
five years. Because, I mean, a lot of



`479 00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,000`
stuff that you have around you



`480 00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,940`
in our IT world today is



`481 00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,880`
configuration, right? It's not program anymore.



`482 00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,920`
It's configuration on an AVS account



`483 00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,180`
or, yeah, some other... And if you make



`484 00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,040`
a mistake there, then you can be as



`485 00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,620`
secure as you want, but you're still gone.



`486 00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,100`
So I think that will be the biggest thing



`487 00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,000`
in a couple of years. So we're looking forward



`488 00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,300`
to the future, right? A bright or a



`489 00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,140`
scary future? Oh, a fun



`490 00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,780`
future. A fun future for us.



`491 00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,600`
Funny stuff. So I'm not



`492 00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,260`
even, you know, everything is



`493 00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,180`
the same now. I'm not curious



`494 00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,300`
or I'm still curious how stuff



`495 00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,720`
work, of course, but I'm not



`496 00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,320`
surprised when things are broken or whatever.



`497 00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,260`
It's the same, same. Over and over



`498 00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:03,140`
again.



`499 00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,260`
Okay, Edvin, thank you so much for



`500 00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,540`
coming to Secretary's Podcast and



`501 00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:10,020`
transmission here from SEC-T at 2021.



`502 00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,320`
It's been a pleasure having you at the seat here



`503 00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,300`
together with Peter, Edvin,



`504 00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,980`
Robin. Thank you for



`505 00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:18,200`
sharing with us your thoughts. Yeah, thank



`506 00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,100`
you for having me, and have a good one. Have a



`507 00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,720`
nice time in Stockholm. Thank you very much.



`508 00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,720`
I will. Thank you. Cheers. Cheers.



`509 00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,020`
So, we are live here from



`510 00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,400`
SEC-T 2021.



`511 00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:31,940`
Stök and



`512 00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,840`
Fabio just came off stage



`513 00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,080`
giving an excellent talk about



`514 00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,820`
some threat hunting they've been doing,



`515 00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,980`
some tools you developed



`516 00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,020`
to figure out how to be



`517 00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:44,060`
a little bit ahead of the bad



`518 00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,820`
guys, right? Yeah. And



`519 00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,120`
maybe a little bit about how to be the bad guys.



`520 00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,240`
Or? It's all of



`521 00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,140`
them, right? That's it. It can't just be



`522 00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,180`
all defense, right?



`523 00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,260`
Everybody likes to hack stuff, but



`524 00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,040`
what I love about this



`525 00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,280`
whole thing that we presented today, which



`526 00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,180`
was



`527 00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:04,200`
incident response,



`528 00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,320`
right, is that that's red teaming



`529 00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,240`
in reverse. Because you need to



`530 00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,320`
understand all the offensive tools being used.



`531 00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,220`
And if you are a good red teamer,



`532 00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,320`
it's going to feel natural for you



`533 00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,120`
when you're doing the whole incident response



`534 00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,180`
thing, because you identify patterns,



`535 00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,660`
and it's like reading redacted



`536 00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,320`
reports that somebody wrote up



`537 00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,240`
and you can see what happens. So I think it's



`538 00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,360`
really interesting. Yeah, and we have the luxury



`539 00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,120`
to have both red teamers and



`540 00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,900`
blue teamers instead of responders



`541 00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,020`
that help doing this,



`542 00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,620`
handling these cases.



`543 00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,180`
And it's always nice to have a red teamer



`544 00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,400`
perspective when you're trying to figure out what an actual



`545 00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,300`
cybercriminal did, because then



`546 00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,180`
you can think from their perspective, like



`547 00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,420`
if I were there, I had this type of access,



`548 00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,400`
I was in this system, and my goal was that.



`549 00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,140`
How would I do it? And then you can



`550 00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,080`
check, is that how they actually did it or not?



`551 00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,480`
And it actually helps a lot.



`552 00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,180`
And the other way around as well, right? What we



`553 00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,260`
learned from incident response, you can apply



`554 00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,180`
into your own red teaming, because if



`555 00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,220`
you know how to find stuff, you also know how to



`556 00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,260`
not be found. Exactly. And I think



`557 00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,160`
also to be a good red teamer,



`558 00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,980`
it helps if you work blue team.



`559 00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,380`
Because you know where



`560 00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,180`
sysadmins get sloppy



`561 00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,220`
and where they sort of



`562 00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,200`
take shortcuts and things like that.



`563 00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,280`
So yeah, it all ties



`564 00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,960`
together. I think it's a good idea



`565 00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,200`
to have both sides of the



`566 00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,280`
house represented in an incident



`567 00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:22,760`
response.



`568 00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,400`
I would throw



`569 00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,300`
into the mix also the monitor and the SOC.



`570 00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,480`
Because



`571 00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,000`
they actually do the detection



`572 00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,160`
and quick response, right? So they



`573 00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,320`
are the ones accepting the rules for what to check for



`574 00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,620`
and



`575 00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,860`
alerting and reacting to that.



`576 00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,280`
So should the SOC people



`577 00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,040`
also go into the red teaming?



`578 00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,260`
I think that's awesome. And we have people



`579 00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,940`
from our SOC that move into pentesting.



`580 00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,860`
So I think that's the best.



`581 00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,500`
The more perspectives you can get



`582 00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,580`
and the more you act



`583 00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,700`
effectively.



`584 00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,060`
I think for me



`585 00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,600`
one of the things



`586 00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,380`
I've worked a lot of incident response



`587 00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,640`
and worked in forensics



`588 00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,860`
in the



`589 00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,900`
before times. But



`590 00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,100`
one thing I liked about your talk



`591 00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,860`
was that you did the analogy about



`592 00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,940`
a jigsaw puzzle



`593 00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,920`
that you have to find the little



`594 00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,760`
pieces and



`595 00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:22,000`
you might not even have all the pieces



`596 00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,460`
but it somehow



`597 00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,440`
creates a picture and



`598 00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,040`
you're keeping that timeline



`599 00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,080`
as basically a security blanket



`600 00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,940`
that you're attaching



`601 00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,820`
everything to and try to correlate



`602 00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,900`
things. So



`603 00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,080`
I really enjoyed that.



`604 00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,140`
What do you think?



`605 00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,680`
I mean you guys develop tools



`606 00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,880`
to sort of build into



`607 00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,700`
that but do you think



`608 00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,740`
there should be



`609 00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,640`
like



`610 00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,480`
you discussed in the talk



`611 00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,960`
Microsoft's



`612 00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,080`
cache for



`613 00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,040`
remote desktop.



`614 00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,580`
Do you think that software companies



`615 00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,320`
like Microsoft should be more



`616 00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,940`
helpful in terms of



`617 00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,780`
creating tools to use



`618 00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,620`
that as incident response



`619 00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,620`
or should that be



`620 00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,440`
thwarted by?



`621 00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,740`
I think yes.



`622 00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,660`
Ideally yes.



`623 00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,400`
But I mean if I'm trying to look from



`624 00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,520`
their perspective



`625 00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,360`
they of course want to work



`626 00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,240`
with giving possibility to detect



`627 00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,240`
and possibly even block stuff



`628 00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,760`
and they do it in their way.



`629 00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,560`
They push their new solutions



`630 00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,000`
and all the new fancy



`631 00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,540`
solutions they have



`632 00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:33,620`
which they're usually good.



`633 00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,240`
They do the right things



`634 00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,140`
provided that you are in a modern



`635 00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,340`
environment and that you have other things in place.



`636 00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,140`
It doesn't make sense to use the latest



`637 00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:43,000`
and greatest if you don't even do the basics.



`638 00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,380`
But here we're talking about missing the basics



`639 00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,300`
and this is the stuff we're left with.



`640 00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,400`
So I don't know. Yes it would be great



`641 00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,380`
to have but I don't see



`642 00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,240`
that there is huge value



`643 00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,940`
for a company like Microsoft to



`644 00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:57,360`
do that. Then again they are sometimes



`645 00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,800`
very transparent. Sometimes not.



`646 00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,340`
But they have tools like



`647 00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,500`
Autoruns and all this stuff anyway.



`648 00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,100`
Yeah I mean that's system terminals



`649 00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,860`
that's you know it's Microsoft.



`650 00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,620`
It's a part of Microsoft that does those.



`651 00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,280`
They could probably just create one that's the RDP



`652 00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,160`
cache explorer.



`653 00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,900`
Sure. Right? Sure. In theory.



`654 00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,780`
And yeah. I mean it's



`655 00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,700`
if possible it's going to come up like but



`656 00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,820`
In theory they will start to use the



`657 00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,840`
CAPTCHAs as do the puzzling



`658 00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,040`
from the RDP cache to show



`659 00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:25,980`
that you're human right?



`660 00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,940`
You just gave me a great idea. I'm going to put the CAPTCHA



`661 00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,880`
Do that. Can you figure out how to



`662 00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,600`
sort Mimikas in this or



`663 00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,440`
Hydra or whatever? Awesome.



`664 00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,200`
Great idea.



`665 00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,220`
You're happy to explore that one.



`666 00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,900`
Perfect. One thing that I picked up on your talk



`667 00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,920`
was all the different tactics



`668 00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,920`
and technologies that you showed



`669 00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,300`
up was a way of describing



`670 00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:49,160`
your actual attack towards



`671 00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,920`
the responders right? Throw away



`672 00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,060`
some stupid error message



`673 00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,180`
that will make



`674 00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:57,020`
the incident responders stop



`675 00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:59,200`
and look another way.



`676 00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,940`
Oh this is just a phishing



`677 00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:03,040`
attack or this is just this and that.



`678 00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,040`
But how common



`679 00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,020`
would you say it is that someone



`680 00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:09,180`
goes in, goes after data and then



`681 00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:11,020`
throws out some bitcoin miner



`682 00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,940`
just to see that oh the



`683 00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,840`
incident responder, oh it's just



`684 00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,740`
a bitcoin miner or a money



`685 00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,940`
miner person that's after us.



`686 00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,460`
Do you have any data on that?



`687 00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,920`
I don't have any data up to the top of my head



`688 00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,980`
but I don't think that's very common among criminal



`689 00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,800`
groups. It is



`690 00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,820`
more common when you have an APT



`691 00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,920`
that actually



`692 00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,100`
has, you know, they have



`693 00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,500`
a lot of resources, they have time



`694 00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,940`
and they can actually do this and they actually



`695 00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,480`
have value in doing that.



`696 00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:40,000`
But



`697 00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,080`
it would be quite



`698 00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,220`
easy just to throw off something.



`699 00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,760`
For sure it would but it also



`700 00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,720`
tells you that it's important to do a thorough



`701 00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,860`
investigation. So when do you stop



`702 00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:53,060`
investigating? When you're



`703 00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,940`
ready to do a full kick out



`704 00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,880`
and you have a plan



`705 00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,880`
for how you're rebuilding. Yeah, because



`706 00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,340`
that's the thing, when you want to do a kick out



`707 00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:02,980`
you need to



`708 00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,940`
make sure you do all the things you need



`709 00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:07,140`
to do at once. Right, say you have



`710 00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,740`
X number of systems compromised



`711 00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:11,080`
and there is backdoors talking



`712 00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,940`
to servers, you know



`713 00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:13,940`
threat after servers



`714 00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:16,400`
their accounts are compromised.



`715 00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,680`
Then you know, okay, I need to



`716 00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,640`
clean that server, I need to block



`717 00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,740`
I need to block



`718 00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,600`
those IPs in the firewall and I need to



`719 00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,140`
reset the passwords for these accounts



`720 00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:28,540`
and they came in through RDP for example



`721 00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:30,500`
so we need to close RDP so they can



`722 00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,420`
come back in the same way and so on.



`723 00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,600`
So all these things, you need to have found them



`724 00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,680`
all ideally so you can do them



`725 00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,360`
at the same time. Because if you do one



`726 00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,760`
but you leave the other, they're going to figure out



`727 00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,580`
that you're doing



`728 00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,580`
that and then they're going to hide it differently.



`729 00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,620`
It doesn't really apply for ransomware cases



`730 00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,800`
so much because, you know, obviously



`731 00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,620`
you've noticed



`732 00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,360`
your shit is gone.



`733 00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:54,620`
So then they know of course there's going to be



`734 00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,200`
an investigation. They're not really in



`735 00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,680`
in most cases, I guess they could be



`736 00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,040`
but



`737 00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:02,540`
that's more for targeted attacks that are not



`738 00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,700`
ransomware. Then you really



`739 00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,800`
want to make sure you find everything before you do the kickout.



`740 00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,720`
And that takes



`741 00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,600`
time and I don't know how, it depends how complex



`742 00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,520`
the environment is and how advanced



`743 00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,640`
and extended the attack is.



`744 00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,580`
It's easy to say also that you



`745 00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:18,580`
probably just change the passwords, right?



`746 00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:22,940`
But you need to change all the passwords, all of them, everything.



`747 00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:23,900`
At the same time, right?



`748 00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,180`
Yeah, at the same time.



`749 00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,940`
And then you need to have another cleaned domain



`750 00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,980`
where you can start working with and, you know,



`751 00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,260`
this is complex stuff.



`752 00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,860`
And you have people working, trying to take care of stuff,



`753 00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,140`
trying to do what they're doing.



`754 00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,100`
Customer is distressed all the time, right?



`755 00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,140`
And asking you, when can we start doing this?



`756 00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,980`
Then losing money by the minute.



`757 00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:44,900`
And so that's also the thing that I love about doing this work



`758 00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,680`
is that when you enter an incident,



`759 00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:50,400`
in the first stages, if it isn't a ransomware,



`760 00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,600`
you are, you're getting called in, adrenaline is pumping,



`761 00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,200`
you're starting to figure things out and you're,



`762 00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,640`
and you know the threat actor is in the system



`763 00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,240`
and you need to figure out how did they get in



`764 00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,860`
and which, and how do we stop them?



`765 00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:08,340`
Because the system can be ransomware at any second



`766 00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,980`
because they don't know you're there.



`767 00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,560`
So you need to be stealthy as well, doing the research.



`768 00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:16,680`
You can't just start a bunch of new user accounts in the domain



`769 00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,920`
naming them your company, consultant one,



`770 00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,540`
because that's going to flag them.



`771 00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:24,380`
So you need to stealth that, look what's going on



`772 00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:27,120`
and then eventually figure out like, do we have backups?



`773 00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,920`
So we create, are we ready?



`774 00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:32,440`
So we don't get that vengeance ransomware



`775 00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,280`
where they just wind it.



`776 00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,120`
Yeah, exactly.



`777 00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,660`
Then they do things, you know, quickly.



`778 00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,500`
Yeah.



`779 00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,420`
Like, you know, the phases are usually,



`780 00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,260`
you take over the entire infrastructure first,



`781 00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,200`
then you go after data.



`782 00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,320`
They usually takes a while to find the right data



`783 00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,260`
and then you steal that.



`784 00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,200`
So you have the additional leverage,



`785 00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:51,200`
when you do the ransomware and then you destroy backups.



`786 00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,880`
They usually also like uninstall AB centrally,



`787 00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,120`
if it's a group policy or whatever, they just push it out.



`788 00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,440`
And then they do the ransomware everywhere at the same time.



`789 00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,440`
If, for example, if you catch them in the middle phase there



`790 00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,280`
when they already have a lot of access,



`791 00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,740`
but they're still, you know,



`792 00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,560`
they still need to go through data to steal



`793 00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,560`
and stuff like that and find the backups.



`794 00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,920`
And they see that you're onto them.



`795 00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:15,360`
They're probably going to be kicked out any minute now.



`796 00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,200`
You know,



`797 00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,960`
the question could be, well, okay,



`798 00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,280`
forget the backups and the data, just do ransomware anyways.



`799 00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,300`
So that's a very bad spot to find them



`800 00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:27,140`
or to at least let them know that you found them.



`801 00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,740`
How common would you say it is



`802 00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:31,280`
that they go after the backups and crash that?



`803 00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,780`
All the time, pretty much.



`804 00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:35,480`
Also that, like you could go persistent



`805 00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,840`
and just encrypt the backups, right?



`806 00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,380`
So during half a year,



`807 00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:43,480`
you start doing the encryption of the backup.



`808 00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,200`
When you do the readback, you do the decryption.



`809 00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,080`
So you don't see that there is a problem.



`810 00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,000`
Yeah.



`811 00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,880`
And then you drop the key.



`812 00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,580`
I see that.



`813 00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:54,800`
But then it's easier to wipe them and do the ransomware.



`814 00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,080`
Yeah, but then you would recognize that, right?



`815 00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,200`
And then you have your offsite.



`816 00:29:59,200 --> 00:29:59,780`
Yeah, okay.



`817 00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:02,580`
If you have actual offsite and offline backups.



`818 00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,260`
Yeah, that's true.



`819 00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,920`
Fair enough.



`820 00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:08,480`
And it's definitely something that could potentially be done.



`821 00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:13,600`
But I'm just going to say they are so successful already.



`822 00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,200`
They haven't even started thinking about more sophisticated



`823 00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,320`
stuff like that.



`824 00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,160`
They don't need to.



`825 00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,120`
They don't need to, yeah.



`826 00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,920`
It's an RFI thing.



`827 00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,080`
You know the delay there is between the first breach



`828 00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,120`
and when they actually start to manually work in the environment?



`829 00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,200`
That can be weeks or months.



`830 00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,640`
No one has seen anything like that.



`831 00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,280`
Imagine how many companies are currently breached



`832 00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,440`
and they are not being actively worked with



`833 00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,920`
because they're working on some other higher priority target.



`834 00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,040`
That can be weeks or months.



`835 00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,640`
Imagine how many they're already in.



`836 00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,640`
They're overloaded with networks they already have access to.



`837 00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,200`
They own you, create persistence, and then they idle.



`838 00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,000`
They just idle until it's time to harvest.



`839 00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,040`
One thing that I really liked as well about your presentation



`840 00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:56,880`
was that you tied in the importance of threat intelligence



`841 00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:03,640`
to be able to proactively find when things are going to hit the fan.



`842 00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,720`
Could you elaborate some more about that?



`843 00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:09,120`
Because I guess that's a case-by-case thing.



`844 00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:16,120`
You gave one example where you had a typical MO for a certain threat actor.



`845 00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:24,200`
But how could you use threat intelligence in a more general way to sort of be on top of things?



`846 00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:29,400`
Yeah, so there are the more technical IOCs type of things that are pretty straightforward.



`847 00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,080`
Like, oh, this IP address is a C2 server.



`848 00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,880`
You can proactively block that, right?



`849 00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,120`
And simple stuff like that.



`850 00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,520`
Or, you know, this email like this domain is sending out phishing emails.



`851 00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,440`
Like, you know, there is so much of that.



`852 00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,760`
And that can be done proactively.



`853 00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,040`
If it's shared, people can block it.



`854 00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,000`
Then the other part is more of like, you know, you can block it.



`855 00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,160`
Then the other part is more of like, you know, you can block it.



`856 00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,600`
Then the other part is more of like, you know, you can block it.



`857 00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,600`
I guess there are different layers.



`858 00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,200`
One is the techniques.



`859 00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,600`
Like the first example we showed about the RTF.



`860 00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:58,080`
That you can talk about, we see this attack that works this way.



`861 00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:03,320`
And this is a relatively generic way you can detect this type of attack even if it's a variation of it.



`862 00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:06,240`
That's tricky to define because it really depends on case-by-case.



`863 00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,000`
So I don't have a good answer for that.



`864 00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:14,240`
But then the layer on top of that, I think it's more generic in terms of what type of attacks are there even?



`865 00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,960`
Like, how common is it?



`866 00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,960`
How common is ransomware?



`867 00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,920`
How common is that they actually delete the backups before the ransomware?



`868 00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:24,400`
If you have those statistics, if you know that in 100% of the cases they delete the backups,



`869 00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,800`
that's probably going to put that at the top of the list if you're going to handle something.



`870 00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:31,400`
Start with securing your backups and testing your backups, right?



`871 00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:36,840`
We do this work when we do like threat intelligence reports and profiles that are specific to customers.



`872 00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:43,000`
We start with like the generic landscape and then narrow it down to what they actually expose and what problems they actually have.



`873 00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,760`
And then we give recommendations that are actually



`874 00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,400`
mapped to the threats that are currently seen in the wild.



`875 00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:55,640`
Because, you know, if you need to start from very low security, there is so many things you can do, right?



`876 00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,720`
Where do you start, right?



`877 00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:02,080`
You should probably do most of them anyways, but you need to have an order for doing it.



`878 00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,080`
Where do you start?



`879 00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:07,560`
Start from the ones that are actively exploited in the wild right now.



`880 00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:13,760`
So we try to do the mapping and give them a plan that is actually mapped to urgency based on what's happening.



`881 00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,720`
But are you also mapping the...



`882 00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:20,760`
Priorities depending on the criticality of the asset that you're protecting?



`883 00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,760`
I mean, it's not just a generic IT environment.



`884 00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,520`
It could be production environments.



`885 00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,120`
It could be ERP systems, et cetera, et cetera.



`886 00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:28,560`
Exactly.



`887 00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,880`
And that needs to start from the business.



`888 00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:33,360`
But it's a question that, of course, is usually asked or is always asked.



`889 00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,200`
Like, what's the worst that can happen, right?



`890 00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:41,680`
How would your business die tomorrow if we don't have, for example, this database or this ERP?



`891 00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:45,640`
Or for us, the uptime is very important, for example.



`892 00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,960`
And then you map it to, okay, these are important assets.



`893 00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,640`
What do they depend on?



`894 00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,000`
Because that's the other challenging part.



`895 00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,320`
Like, they maybe depend on a hundred different third-party software that we have no idea about.



`896 00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,320`
So what if they get breached?



`897 00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:02,240`
And do they even know what they depend on?



`898 00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,400`
They usually don't.



`899 00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,320`
They usually don't.



`900 00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:05,960`
And it's not easy.



`901 00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,400`
In their defense, it's hard.



`902 00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,760`
The systems are complex.



`903 00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,120`
Yeah, absolutely.



`904 00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,080`
Looking especially at the Kaseya stuff.



`905 00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,920`
I mean, you're looking at several layers of dependencies, right?



`906 00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,120`
Yeah.



`907 00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:15,560`
Yeah.



`908 00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:21,240`
But then again, facts in hindsight proved that Kaseya was pretty broken.



`909 00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:24,480`
And, you know, that they weren't focusing on that.



`910 00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,200`
And people are relying on the trust from suppliers.



`911 00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:35,000`
So, but if we remove that idea and say, okay, I got this IT environment that's mine that I'm the guard of.



`912 00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,840`
I'm Susanne or whatever.



`913 00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,560`
And I have a bunch of things that are exposed to the internet.



`914 00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:45,120`
What I would do personally is I would constantly just git pull the latest nuclei.



`915 00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,880`
Templates and whatever.



`916 00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,480`
And just scan my environment continuously.



`917 00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:54,680`
Because that's where like one day CVs come out and see if it smashes your system.



`918 00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:57,800`
If it fits, send yourself a notification in Slack.



`919 00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,240`
This is CV fired.



`920 00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,720`
False positive or not.



`921 00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,840`
Like use the bug bounty methodology and attack your system externally.



`922 00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:08,120`
Because if you don't do it, somebody else is going to do it for you.



`923 00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,320`
And if it fires, at least then you know.



`924 00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,000`
And it's 100% better to know what you're having that's vulnerable.



`925 00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,800`
And it's 100% better to know what you're having that's vulnerable.



`926 00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,000`
And it's 100% better to know what you're having that's vulnerable.



`927 00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000`
Than not having it.



`928 00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000`
Than not having it.



`929 00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,640`
And if you don't have the capabilities to do it yourself, I guess that maps to whatever



`930 00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:26,120`
sort of vulnerability exposure type of thing you can put on the outside, right?



`931 00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,760`
Now, I don't even know what products there are to be honest.



`932 00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,760`
I know there are many.



`933 00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:35,760`
Ideally, you have hackers like stuff that can do that for you continuously.



`934 00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,440`
But you know, they got other stuff to do as well.



`935 00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:44,800`
But I mean, identifying the exposure is very important and also be very quick when things



`936 00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,800`
happen.



`937 00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,360`
Because step number one is inventory.



`938 00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,800`
Know what you actually have.



`939 00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,800`
Especially what you're exposed to in the internet.



`940 00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:55,800`
And step number two is be consistent with the patching level.



`941 00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,720`
And it's boring to talk about patching.



`942 00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:03,560`
No one likes to like, you know, go through the process of doing the inventory and check



`943 00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,560`
the version.



`944 00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,560`
Because the heroes of the off time.



`945 00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:09,420`
Make sure it's a patch and get the notification when there is a new patch available and stuff.



`946 00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:10,420`
But take stats.



`947 00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,800`
It's actually, if you look at our own stats.



`948 00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,800`
It's actually, if you look at our own stats.



`949 00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,800`
It's actually, if you look at our own stats.



`950 00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,800`
It's actually, if you look at our own stats.



`951 00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,800`
It's actually, if you look at our own stats.



`952 00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,800`
You can see, there is a lot of stats that have been released from around 100 different



`953 00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,000`
cases so far this year.



`954 00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:27,800`
I think the highest number on what initial access back to the use is external exploitation.



`955 00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,800`
And next is phishing.



`956 00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:35,800`
And you will see those nice firewalls with VPNs enabled just for the IT admins that



`957 00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,800`
they forgot about.



`958 00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,800`
Or that kind of stuff that's happening all the time.



`959 00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,800`
Because you do that, the easiest route, right?



`960 00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,800`
It's on the internet.



`961 00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:49,800`
No one likes to talk about patching, but it's actually very important.



`962 00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:54,800`
First, reduce the exposure. If you don't have to have it exposed, don't have it.



`963 00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:00,800`
If you need to have it exposed, but not necessarily have to have it hosted in your on-prem infrastructure,



`964 00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,800`
put it on a cloud service. That's a lot better.



`965 00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,800`
If it gets pawned, at least it's not your infrastructure.



`966 00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:12,800`
It's your app, but still, it's a lot better than having it into your internal network.



`967 00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:17,800`
Exactly. I think that's a good note to end on.



`968 00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:21,800`
Thank you a lot for taking the time to talk to us.



`969 00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:25,800`
You guys are done now, so you can just enjoy it.



`970 00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:29,800`
Enjoy the sun, enjoy the show, enjoy the venue.



`971 00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,800`
And have a nice day in Stockholm.



`972 00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,800`
Thank you for sharing with us on Säkerhetspodkasten.



`973 00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,800`
Fabio, Fredrik, thank you.



`974 00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,800`
Thank you very much.



`975 00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,800`
We're rolling. Welcome off the stage.



`976 00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,800`
Lars, how are you?



`977 00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:50,800`
Just gave an excellent talk about exploiting memory corruption in RTOS, real-time operating systems.



`978 00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:56,800`
Together here with me at the Säkerhetspodkasten transmission from Säkti is also Peter Magnusson.



`979 00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,800`
Hello\!



`980 00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,800`
And Lars Hallin.



`981 00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,800`
Yes.



`982 00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:05,800`
Cool. And let's just go and head right into the questions, right?



`983 00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,800`
And then follow up on your talk on a little...



`984 00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,800`
You described this as some kind of a summer experience.



`985 00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,800`
A summer experiment or summer hobby project that you brought up.



`986 00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,800`
Yes, that's right.



`987 00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,800`
So, where did it come from?



`988 00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:25,800`
I mean, where did the first idea to go into this come from?



`989 00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:31,800`
Well, I have previously been working as an embedded systems developer.



`990 00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:38,800`
So these questions like, how secure is this when we add these compiler flags to these operating systems?



`991 00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,800`
I have been thinking that question for a while.



`992 00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:48,800`
But then I thought, well, maybe I should try to learn Docker and make something with it.



`993 00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,800`
So that was my main driving force.



`994 00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:59,800`
So the Docker drive went into building a playground for playing around with memory corruption in RTOS?



`995 00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,800`
Yes.



`996 00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:06,800`
Myself, I have all kind of electrical equipment at home.



`997 00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,800`
Debuggers and debugging probes.



`998 00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,800`
And microcontrollers.



`999 00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,800`
So that makes it a bit easier for me.



`1000 00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:22,800`
But I wanted to make something that could be used by anyone as long as they have a computer or cloud resources that they can run a Docker container in.



`1001 00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,800`
So a huge improvement on accessibility?



`1002 00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,800`
Well, that depends.



`1003 00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,800`
I hope so, at least.



`1004 00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,800`
We will see.



`1005 00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:35,800`
I hope to get comments and so on the actual thing.



`1006 00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,800`
What about compared to getting...



`1007 00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:44,800`
The microcontroller and rigging it up to your computer and making everything work?



`1008 00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,800`
I would actually say that that is a better experience.



`1009 00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,800`
There are really, really good tools for that.



`1010 00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,800`
Some of them are free.



`1011 00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,800`
But there are also some that you pay a bit for.



`1012 00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:02,800`
And wow, they are made to make your work efficient.



`1013 00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,800`
And you can really feel that.



`1014 00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,800`
So what price level are we talking about?



`1015 00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,800`
Are we talking about your oscilloscopes at home?



`1016 00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,800`
I don't have any oscilloscopes at home at the moment.



`1017 00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:21,800`
But if I ask nicely, I might be able to use one at work.



`1018 00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:25,800`
Not the calibrated ones, because those are only for work.



`1019 00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,800`
But maybe one of the test oscilloscopes.



`1020 00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,800`
But now we have the playground, right?



`1021 00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,800`
Yes, we have.



`1022 00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,800`
Okay.



`1023 00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,800`
So tell us a little bit.



`1024 00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,800`
You made a demo on stage.



`1025 00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,800`
Mm.



`1026 00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,800`
Did you analyze it and play around a little bit with it?



`1027 00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:44,800`
And one thing that came up and one thing that you explored a little bit was the canary functionality.



`1028 00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,800`
Yes, that's right.



`1029 00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:50,800`
How common would you say it is in the Nartos 2 that they use these canary protections?



`1030 00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,800`
Well, I would say it depends.



`1031 00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:57,800`
I think you should add the protection if you can.



`1032 00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,800`
But often you have some memory constraints.



`1033 00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:05,800`
And I have a fun story from when I was working



`1034 00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,800`
as an embedded developer.



`1035 00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,800`
And I was asking, can we make this program 80 bytes smaller?



`1036 00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:15,800`
Because if we can do that, we can fit it into one kilobyte of flash



`1037 00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,800`
instead of two kilobytes of flash.



`1038 00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,800`
And you save a lot of money, right?



`1039 00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,800`
Yes.



`1040 00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,800`
And you don't realize how much money you save.



`1041 00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:28,800`
But if that is 30 cents per chip and you manufacture 500,000 per year,



`1042 00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,800`
it adds up.



`1043 00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,800`
It really adds up.



`1044 00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,800`
You try to tell that to the programmers over there.



`1045 00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:42,800`
I have this like, we're talking about this many hours of engineering



`1046 00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:51,800`
and yeah, but bill of material for making this profitable is this much?



`1047 00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,800`
We don't care about how much hours you spend.



`1048 00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:59,800`
That's a really, really strange equation where you're like, this is silly.



`1049 00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,800`
And that's why television sets are slow.



`1050 00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,800`
I mean, when you switch channels.



`1051 00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,800`
It's like they save 50 cents on a microcontroller.



`1052 00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,800`
Yeah, sure.



`1053 00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,800`
They could put something fast in there.



`1054 00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,800`
Yeah.



`1055 00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:15,800`
So, I mean, the talk was, of course, of interest because normally in a real-time



`1056 00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:19,800`
operating system, you put that in important stuff, right?



`1057 00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,800`
What do you mean?



`1058 00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,800`
I mean, stuff that keeps you alive.



`1059 00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,800`
Yes.



`1060 00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,800`
Or keeps things flying in the air.



`1061 00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,800`
Yeah.



`1062 00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,800`
Segways, also, probably.



`1063 00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,800`
All kind of control systems and things.



`1064 00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,800`
Yeah.



`1065 00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:39,800`
So, I had some like, how common is real-time operating systems?



`1066 00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:45,800`
Because you were looking at two different, one free RTOS and one was called Cephs or



`1067 00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,800`
something.



`1068 00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,800`
Cypher, yeah.



`1069 00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,800`
Yeah.



`1070 00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,800`
From the Linux Foundation.



`1071 00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:58,800`
And how different experience is that compared to some corporations where, for example,



`1072 00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,800`
you get a small base from...



`1073 00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:06,800`
From STM32 or some other company where they...



`1074 00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:13,800`
You basically just build the embedded thing upon a very small C library and start there.



`1075 00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,800`
It's...



`1076 00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:21,000`
Do you know which companies choose to go for a real-time operating system and which ones



`1077 00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,800`
would just go like raw upon a small...



`1078 00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,800`
Yeah, a small loop like an Arduino.



`1079 00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:28,800`
Yeah.



`1080 00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,800`
Usually, this is the decision that you take on an architectural level.



`1081 00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,800`
So, you look at what does this system need to do.



`1082 00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:43,800`
And usually, it's when you have some kind of shared resource that you need to have accessible



`1083 00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,800`
to several different parts of the program.



`1084 00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:53,800`
Let's say that you access a network port or some kind of SD card or something, some



`1085 00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:57,800`
storage or some communication bus.



`1086 00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,800`
But you need to have shared between the...



`1087 00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,800`
Then you need to have a mutual exclusion, mutexes.



`1088 00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:03,800`
Yeah, yeah.



`1089 00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:08,800`
So, if you just controlling like turning on and off a lamp or something like that, maybe



`1090 00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,800`
you don't need an operating system.



`1091 00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,800`
But if you got network connections and you got...



`1092 00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:20,800`
It's about the same level as when you want to be having multi-threaded programs in a



`1093 00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,800`
normal general purpose computer.



`1094 00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:26,800`
But do you also see...



`1095 00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:32,800`
I mean, the threat level towards smart cards, for instance, and mobile phones, et cetera,



`1096 00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:33,800`
has raised the...



`1097 00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:37,800`
I mean, the architectural protection of these kinds of systems.



`1098 00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:43,800`
I mean, also the embedded systems get, I mean, memory protection and all kinds of protection



`1099 00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:47,800`
and safe environments for trust zones, et cetera.



`1100 00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:54,800`
Would you say that this will start to be implemented also in these kinds of equipment that you're



`1101 00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:55,800`
looking at?



`1102 00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:59,800`
Because more bare bones are those systems are...



`1103 00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,800`
Like secure boot, for instance.



`1104 00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,800`
To be honest, I don't know.



`1105 00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,800`
It really depends.



`1106 00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:12,800`
Because some of these systems are so small that you can make them provably correct or



`1107 00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,800`
that you are sure that...



`1108 00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,800`
We have bound checks everywhere.



`1109 00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:21,800`
So, if you have a small enough program, it's much easier to prove that it doesn't have



`1110 00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:22,800`
any bugs.



`1111 00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,800`
However, when you bring in code that you haven't written on the computer, it's much



`1112 00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:25,800`
easier to prove that it doesn't have any bugs.



`1113 00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,800`
Then you can utilize a basketball once you have done your own, like externa libraries,



`1114 00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:28,800`
et cetera.



`1115 00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:29,800`
I mean, I mentioned this...



`1116 00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:30,800`
Network stack, or UDSD stack, or...



`1117 00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:31,800`
Yeah.



`1118 00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:37,800`
I mean, I mentioned this in the talk and say the formal term is Software of Unknown Provenance.



`1119 00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,800`
Then you don't know what is.



`1120 00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:49,200`
You add these extra things to let's say that if there should be a bug in this code, then



`1121 00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:52,800`
we have at least made something to mitigate that risk.



`1122 00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,800`
So, it won't be a catastrophic error or something?



`1123 00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,240`
för personen med pacemaker?



`1124 00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:05,280`
Om man har en pacemaker så är jag inte så säker på om de kommer att fungera i en



`1125 00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,640`
real-time operating system eftersom det är så resursintensivt.



`1126 00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:17,040`
Jag har inte jobbat med pacemakers men jag hade några kollegor som hade jobbat med



`1127 00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:20,400`
pacemakers om jag minns rätt, eller om de hade kollegor.



`1128 00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:25,280`
Det är inte mer än tre nivåer av möten.



`1129 00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:29,760`
Det var skrivet i assembleringsspråk.



`1130 00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:33,520`
Och det är helt säkert, eller hur?



`1131 00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:38,560`
Men det var inte stora program?



`1132 00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:45,920`
I företaget jag har jobbat i var en av problemen en C-kompiler error.



`1133 00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,760`
Kodbasen



`1134 00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,840`
inte fungerade och bröt



`1135 00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:50,320`
på en



`1136 00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:54,080`
specifik system och kompilerade i en specifik mån.



`1137 00:46:54,080 --> 00:47:01,440`
Och de bestämde i slutändan att den här kompilern i de här och de här förhållandena



`1138 00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:06,640`
genererar något som inte gör vad C-koden säger.



`1139 00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:11,760`
Undisput, det här är problemet och i slutändan tror jag att de



`1140 00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,080`
fick en bugfix för den här kompilernas problem.



`1141 00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:19,760`
Men jag är inte säker på hur man skulle göra en beslut där.



`1142 00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:24,560`
Men i den här fallet, jag skulle säga 99% av fallet,



`1143 00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:29,920`
det vore galet om man hade ett problem och bara fick en assembleringsspråk



`1144 00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,800`
för då vet jag vad det gör.



`1145 00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:38,240`
Det verkar galet, men i den här specifika scenen när



`1146 00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:43,600`
vi har förlorat så många timmar och vi vet att den här kompilern



`1147 00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:47,600`
för den här specifika konfigurationen genererar en skitutsläpp.



`1148 00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:56,560`
Så kan du faktiskt tro på en C-kompilering för att exekutera kritiska koder i en artist?



`1149 00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:00,000`
Ja, du kan, men inte någon C-kompilering.



`1150 00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,640`
Okej, så välj viss, eller hur?



`1151 00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:09,600`
Ja, så det finns några C-kompileringar som faktiskt ger garanter för att deras kod är korrekt.



`1152 00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,200`
Det är intressant.



`1153 00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,200`
Men de här är inte de fria.



`1154 00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,200`
Nej, det kan jag förvänta mig.



`1155 00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:19,560`
Jag kan nästan inte se någon softwareförening som ger någon garanti på deras kod.



`1156 00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:27,360`
Ja, jag skrev faktiskt min mastertesis på en kompilering som gjorde det.



`1157 00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:36,360`
Det var en väldigt bra fråga, det var ingen förberedelse, det var bara fritt lycka.



`1158 00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:46,360`
Jag hörde att det fanns en språk om flygförsäkringssäkerhet och programmering på flygsystem.



`1159 00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:48,360`
Och det fanns många C-kompileringar och C-kompileringar.



`1160 00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,360`
Ja, det fanns många C-kompileringar och C-kompileringar.



`1161 00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,360`
Och det fanns många C-kompileringar och C-kompileringar.



`1162 00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:57,360`
Och den personen frågade om kvalitetsförsäkring.



`1163 00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:07,360`
Och han sa, ställ dig upp om någon av er skulle gå på en flygplans där din företag skapar software som kontrollerar flygplans.



`1164 00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:10,360`
Och det var bara en person som ställde upp handen.



`1165 00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:15,360`
Och jag sa, okej, ja, coolt, det blir inget problem.



`1166 00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,360`
Vi kommer inte ens att gå på en flygplans om vi skriver den koden.



`1167 00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,360`
Vi kommer inte ens att gå på en flygplans om vi skriver den koden.



`1168 00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,360`
Ja, det skriver vi inte.



`1169 00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:25,360`
Så det är svårt att skriva bra software överallt.



`1170 00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:27,360`
Ja, det är det.



`1171 00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:29,360`
Okej, vi...



`1172 00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:32,360`
Låt oss återkomma till frågan på den här intervjun.



`1173 00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:38,360`
Men det finns en bekämpande författning där de var rätt vissa rädda...



`1174 00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,360`
att luft...



`1175 00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:42,360`
att luft...



`1176 00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:44,360`
att luft...



`1177 00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:45,360`
att luft...



`1178 00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:47,360`
att luft?



`1179 00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:50,620`
I think it's an airbus incident



`1180 00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:51,320`
Or something like that



`1181 00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:54,380`
It's not



`1182 00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:55,940`
100% proven



`1183 00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:58,220`
But it seems like the accident



`1184 00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:00,680`
Started with one of the flight computers



`1185 00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:01,520`
Flipping a bit



`1186 00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,880`
And it's hard to prove



`1187 00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:05,220`
Because it's



`1188 00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:07,920`
I think they call it soft faults



`1189 00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:08,600`
Or something like



`1190 00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:11,200`
You flip a bit but there's no



`1191 00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,660`
Permanent damage to the computer



`1192 00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:15,360`
So you can just look at



`1193 00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:17,200`
The output and what was registered



`1194 00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,640`
And the simplest explanation



`1195 00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:21,660`
Was one bit was flipped



`1196 00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:23,520`
So could you actually do that



`1197 00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,560`
Kind of simulation in the playground



`1198 00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,180`
The random bit flipping



`1199 00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:27,920`
Not yet



`1200 00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:31,620`
But you could probably just stop



`1201 00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:32,780`
The QM



`1202 00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,800`
And flip a bit in RAM



`1203 00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,980`
You could of course do that



`1204 00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:37,860`
But that's not really



`1205 00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:40,220`
Just play something radioactive



`1206 00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:41,320`
Close to the processor



`1207 00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:43,420`
Close to the docker image



`1208 00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:45,340`
That's what we have



`1209 00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:46,080`
The ECC



`1210 00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:48,580`
Or whatever it's called



`1211 00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:51,340`
Self-correcting RAM memories



`1212 00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:53,520`
So we can mitigate those risks



`1213 00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,420`
At least it reduces



`1214 00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:56,060`
It's heavily



`1215 00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:58,020`
But then you have the raw hammer attack



`1216 00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:02,120`
Writing rapidly to one memory port



`1217 00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:03,760`
And get bit flips



`1218 00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:04,620`
On the other side



`1219 00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:07,560`
So we were asked



`1220 00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:10,020`
By the organizers of the event



`1221 00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:11,620`
To look through the questions



`1222 00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:12,020`
And



`1223 00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:14,960`
Most of the questions



`1224 00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:15,320`
Were the same



`1225 00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:17,500`
That they either were



`1226 00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:20,660`
Weird or we didn't understand them



`1227 00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,260`
It was one good question



`1228 00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:23,300`
That was



`1229 00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:25,280`
Should you write



`1230 00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,420`
Embedded software in Rust



`1231 00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:28,220`
Instead of C



`1232 00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:31,320`
That depends



`1233 00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:36,000`
I personally haven't been working much



`1234 00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:36,520`
With Rust



`1235 00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:38,440`
Then we're on the team



`1236 00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:41,000`
But I have



`1237 00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,980`
Friends



`1238 00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:45,320`
Who are really liking it



`1239 00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:46,380`
And speaking for it



`1240 00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:49,040`
But one thing you need to consider



`1241 00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,540`
Is say that you're using



`1242 00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:51,360`
An old code base



`1243 00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,360`
That is written in C



`1244 00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:55,640`
Do you really rewrite everything



`1245 00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:57,900`
And if you make a new implementation



`1246 00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:00,060`
Do you really make a new new implementation



`1247 00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:02,020`
Or are you basing it on libraries



`1248 00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:04,280`
And what are those libraries written in



`1249 00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:05,980`
I don't think it's



`1250 00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:07,720`
It is not yet



`1251 00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:08,740`
Close



`1252 00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:11,520`
In time



`1253 00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:14,180`
That we see the majority of the systems



`1254 00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:15,000`
Written in Rust



`1255 00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:16,320`
But I definitely



`1256 00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:18,260`
Think that



`1257 00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:19,860`
There will be good things



`1258 00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:20,540`
Coming there



`1259 00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:23,260`
That's a good



`1260 00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:25,720`
Ending of this presentation



`1261 00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:27,600`
I think Lars



`1262 00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,800`
It's been a pleasure having you on board



`1263 00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,620`
This small small



`1264 00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:33,800`
Follow up interview on your presentation on stage



`1265 00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:34,640`
Here at



`1266 00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:38,020`
Can I ask one question



`1267 00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:38,980`
The last question



`1268 00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:41,560`
I'll let you do that



`1269 00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:43,280`
So



`1270 00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,340`
One of your demos



`1271 00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:46,780`
Was on



`1272 00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:48,620`
Bad



`1273 00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:50,540`
Stack canaries



`1274 00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:52,580`
Was it free art



`1275 00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:54,060`
No that was in



`1276 00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:56,240`
All the live demos were in Sapphire



`1277 00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:56,800`
Okay



`1278 00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,680`
Do you know if Sapphire



`1279 00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:02,040`
Has recommendations for



`1280 00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:04,960`
Like how you should do



`1281 00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:05,760`
Stack canaries



`1282 00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,960`
Do they instruct



`1283 00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:11,180`
Is there some instruction on changing the code



`1284 00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:11,920`
To make it



`1285 00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,000`
Because one



`1286 00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:13,320`
One



`1287 00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:13,460`
One



`1288 00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:14,820`
One



`1289 00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:15,320`
One



`1290 00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:33,760`
One



`1291 00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:39,140`
What doesoke



`1292 00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:40,600`
Arduino



`1293 00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:42,700`
If



`1294 00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:42,760`
More



`1295 00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:43,440`
Or



`1296 00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:43,820`
Short



`1297 00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:44,820`
Or



`1298 00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:44,900`
Time



`1299 00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:44,920`
L



`1300 00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:45,000`
All set



`1301 00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:45,040`
In



`1302 00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:45,260`
And



`1303 00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:45,280`
Yes



`1304 00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:45,300`
It's



`1305 00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:54,300`
Men jag har säkert berättat om F, men även om vackra ombedda arkitekter som är mindre bekämpande.



`1306 00:53:54,300 --> 00:54:00,300`
Men jag är inte en ombedd utvecklare, jag har bara en liten del av en ombedd erfarenhet.



`1307 00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:07,300`
Jag har jobbat mer tillsammans med ombedda utvecklare än med mitt eget arbete.



`1308 00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:15,300`
Men till exempel på SDM32 kommer de med en liten random nummergenerator.



`1309 00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:20,300`
Så man kan teoretiskt börja...



`1310 00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:28,300`
Det kan vara för lätt att alltid välja en random värde, för det är mycket kod som man kan få.



`1311 00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:33,300`
Men man kan åtminstone ha en random början av stackgeneratorn.



`1312 00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:36,300`
Men...



`1313 00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:37,300`
Men jag menar...



`1314 00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:39,300`
I GCC och andra saker...



`1315 00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:43,300`
Jag tror att man behöver implementera något för att få bra stackgenerator.



`1316 00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:45,300`
Så det är lite...



`1317 00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:49,300`
Säger de något om hur man implementerar det?



`1318 00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:55,300`
Jag har inte läst så mycket på dokumentationen om det.



`1319 00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:58,300`
Jag har bara hittat den här flaggan, enabla stackgeneratorn.



`1320 00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:03,300`
Och jag måste vara ärlig, jag vet inte om den flaggan var korrekt.



`1321 00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:06,300`
För som ni kanske har sett i presentationen...



`1322 00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:12,300`
Det är den som har adressen till stackgeneratorn.



`1323 00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:14,300`
Och inte värdena av stackgeneratorn.



`1324 00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:16,300`
Så det var faktiskt samma hela tiden.



`1325 00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:18,300`
Och det är inte så att det ska vara så.



`1326 00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:22,300`
Jag undrade mig själv på den här i första stället.



`1327 00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:25,300`
Men jag kommer verkligen att undersöka det lite mer.



`1328 00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:28,300`
Jag hittade just den här dagarna.



`1329 00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:33,300`
Och jag hade redan den här områdena jag planerade att presentera.



`1330 00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:34,300`
Ja, ja, ja.



`1331 00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:35,300`
Men det var verkligen...



`1332 00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:36,300`
Det var verkligen...



`1333 00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:38,300`
Det här är så olyckligt.



`1334 00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:40,300`
Så det kan vara något du har hittat.



`1335 00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:43,300`
Det kan vara titeln av ditt nästa tal.



`1336 00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:53,300`
Men det är normalt att oavsett om du har implementerat randomiteten till stackgeneratorn...



`1337 00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:59,300`
Den defaulta implementeringen måste vara tråkigt om det inte finns något där.



`1338 00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:01,300`
Jag menar...



`1339 00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:03,300`
Om det inte finns något där...



`1340 00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:07,300`
Hur genererar du randomitet när du inte har någon randomisering?



`1341 00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:08,300`
Det är en typisk problem.



`1342 00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:13,300`
Jag nämnde en annan talgång under min talgång.



`1343 00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:18,300`
Och om jag minns rätt så var det i den talgången att han faktiskt hade en plan för det.



`1344 00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:22,300`
Man kan använda den initiala konditionen av SRAM.



`1345 00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:23,300`
Den biasen där.



`1346 00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:26,300`
För det är lite fluktuerande.



`1347 00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:28,300`
Men jag rekommenderar den talgången.



`1348 00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:29,300`
Gå och se den.



`1349 00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:32,300`
Och hur man simulerar det är...



`1350 00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:35,300`
I min fall hade jag den här emulatoren.



`1351 00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:38,300`
Och den emulatoren kommer nog att hända med alla zeroer.



`1352 00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:40,300`
Så det skulle nog inte vara någon entropi.



`1353 00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:45,300`
Det finns en företag, jag minns inte om de är svenska eller något.



`1354 00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:50,300`
Men de tror att de kan generera...



`1355 00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:53,300`
Jag tror att de kan kalla det intrinsek eller något.



`1356 00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:56,300`
Men deras idé är något som...



`1357 00:56:56,300 --> 00:57:01,300`
SRAM tänds att förlora på samma sätt.



`1358 00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:05,300`
Eller förlora på samma sätt på alla båtar.



`1359 00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:10,300`
Det är något som de borde kunna förlora från en kilobyte av SRAM.



`1360 00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:15,300`
Den random initiala konditionen borde vara möjlig att förlora...



`1361 00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:20,300`
En key som blir samma på alla båtar.



`1362 00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:22,300`
Men det är inte klonbara?



`1363 00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:25,300`
Nej, det är klonbara.



`1364 00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:30,300`
Men det ska vara unikt för alla båtar.



`1365 00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:35,300`
För idéen är att båtdiften blir annorlunda.



`1366 00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:39,300`
Så jag tror att idéen är något som...



`1367 00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:42,300`
Den initialiseringen av SRAM...



`1368 00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:45,300`
Eftersom man inte skriver något till den på båtar...



`1369 00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:50,300`
Det blir inte samma för alla båtar.



`1370 00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:54,300`
Så alla båtar blir lite annorlunda för det var på ett annat sätt.



`1371 00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:56,300`
Puff? Är det P-U-F?



`1372 00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:58,300`
Ja, det är en av...



`1373 00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:00,300`
Det är en av de funktionsnedsättningarna.



`1374 00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:02,300`
Det är en av de Puff-teknikerna, ja.



`1375 00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:03,300`
Coolt\!



`1376 00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:08,300`
Så låt oss lyssna på den här frågan och kanske titta mer på Puffs.



`1377 00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:11,300`
Och se om det kan vara lösningen till Canary-problemet.



`1378 00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:15,300`
Som kanske finns i några av de här R2.



`1379 00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:19,300`
Okej Lars, tack så mycket för att du har med dig dina tankar.



`1380 00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:21,300`
Ja, tack för att du har med dig mig på podcasten.



`1381 00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:23,300`
Ja, inget problem. Det är vårt glädje.



`1382 00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:27,300`
Och ha en bra tid här på resten av konferensen.



`1383 00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:29,300`
Vi ses 2021 den här gången.



`1384 00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:31,300`
Hejdå\!



`1385 00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:35,300`
Outro kommer snart.
