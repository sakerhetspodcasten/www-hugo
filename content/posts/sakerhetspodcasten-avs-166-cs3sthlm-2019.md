`1 00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,480`
Hej och välkomna till Säkerhetspodcasten från CS3 Stockholm 2019.



`2 00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:17,480`
Och det här intervjun är jag väldigt glad att se på, för på den runda sidan har jag Jesper Larsson från Storbritannien.



`3 00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,220`
Ja, det är sant. Jag gjorde det här.



`4 00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:25,720`
Och på andra sidan av talet har vi deras gäst och keynote-pråkare av dagen, Andy Grimberg.



`5 00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,400`
Hej, glad att vara här.



`6 00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:34,500`
Och låt oss börja med en kort introduktion om dig själv och om huvudet av ditt språk.



`7 00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:41,540`
Ja, så jag är en skrivare för Wired Magazine och jag har skrivit en bok som heter Sandworm.



`8 00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:49,640`
Det är, jag tror, historien om den första fullblåna cyberkriget som verkligen sker.



`9 00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:56,640`
Och det träffar den ena hackargruppen som kallas Sandworm från deras första existering.



`10 00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:27,380`
Och det är, jag tror, historien om den första fullblåna cyberkriget som verkligen sker.



`11 00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:27,400`
Och det är, jag tror, historien om den första fullblåna cyberkriget som verkligen sker.



`12 00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:57,380`
Och det är, jag tror, historien om den första fullblåna cyberkriget som verkligen sker.



`13 00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:27,360`
Och jag tror, historien om den första fullblåna cyberkriget som verkligen sker.



`14 00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:57,360`
Och jag tror, historien om den första fullblåna cyberkriget som verkligen sker.



`15 00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:27,340`
Och jag tror, historien om den första fullblåna cyberkriget som verkligen sker.



`16 00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:57,320`
Och jag tror, historien om den första fullblåna cyberkriget som verkligen sker.



`17 00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:27,320`
Och jag tror, historien om den första fullblåna cyberkriget som verkligen sker.



`18 00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:57,300`
Och jag tror, historien om den första fullblåna cyberkriget som verkligen sker.



`19 00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:27,280`
Och jag tror, historien om den första fullblåna cyberkriget som verkligen sker.



`20 00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:57,280`
Och jag tror, historien om den första fullblåna cyberkriget som verkligen sker.



`21 00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:27,280`

`23 00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:27,280`
Och jag tror, historien om den första fullblåna cyberkriget som verkligen sker.



`24 00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:57,280`
Och jag tror, historien om den första fullblåna cyberkriget som verkligen sker.



`25 00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:27,280`
Och jag tror, historien om den första fullblåna cyberkriget som verkligen sker.



`26 00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:57,280`
Och jag tror, historien om den första fullblåna cyberkriget som verkligen sker.



`27 00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:27,280`
Och jag tror, historien om den första fullblåna cyberkriget som verkligen sker.



`28 00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:57,280`
Och jag tror, historien om den första fullblåna cyberkriget som verkligen sker.



`29 00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:27,280`
Och jag tror, historien om den första fullblåna cyberkriget som verkligen sker.



`30 00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:56,640`

`31 00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,140`
Och jag tror, historien om den första fullblåna cyberkriget som verkligen sker.



`32 00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:57,280`
Och jag tror, historien om den första fullblåna cyberkriget som verkligen sker.



`33 00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,380`
I just talked about today at CS3 Stockholm.



`34 00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:04,420`
I don't think, you know, unless you've read the book, it's not public anywhere.



`35 00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,160`
I don't think.



`36 00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,460`
Like I, maybe it's been...



`37 00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,000`
To the data loss thing?



`38 00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,100`
Yeah, this affected NotPetya on hospitals is something that I was surprised to learn about.



`39 00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,600`
It was not, because, you know, you hear about the damages of NotPetya on public companies.



`40 00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,780`
They have to tell their shareholders.



`41 00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:25,340`
Hospitals have not always been so forthcoming.



`42 00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:31,820`
And I think it was surprising to me that NotPetya actually affected probably hundreds of American hospitals.



`43 00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,480`
Not directly, but because they shut down this speech-to-text software firm, Nuance,



`44 00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,800`
that these hospitals use for medical record transcription.



`45 00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:46,780`
And as a result, hospitals were like losing millions of updates to medical records.



`46 00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,980`
And they didn't know which ones were updated and which ones weren't.



`47 00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:54,980`
Which in the case of, you know, I told the story in the talk today of like a IT-centralist



`48 00:11:55,340 --> 00:12:02,320`
staffer at a major hospital who like a nurse came up to her in this panic telling her,



`49 00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:05,520`
we have a child who needs to be transferred for a procedure.



`50 00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:09,740`
And we don't know if the child has been cleared for surgery because their medical record is incomplete.



`51 00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:15,620`
And they had to track down in the raw audio files the missing change that had been lost



`52 00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:19,640`
because Nuance was down, this software firm.



`53 00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:25,120`
And then that happened three more times in a week with just barely like hours,



`54 00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:28,020`
before actual effects on someone's health.



`55 00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:33,560`
So I couldn't find a case where somebody was actually harmed, you know,



`56 00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:36,780`
their health was harmed directly as a result of NotPetya.



`57 00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:42,820`
But when you hear those stories like three times in a week that they almost had to delay



`58 00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:49,580`
or cancel a surgery, and then you multiply that out by hundreds and thousands of patients



`59 00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:54,860`
at dozens or hundreds of hospitals in the U.S. alone, and there were hospitals shut down



`60 00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:55,260`
in Ukraine.



`61 00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:58,780`
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think that like,



`62 00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:04,660`
it's hard to say that there wasn't some harm done to some human's health or life as a result of NotPetya too.



`63 00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:05,580`
Exactly.



`64 00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,660`
And that's not captured in the dollar numbers.



`65 00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,380`
No, no.



`66 00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:17,060`
But, and I mean, you also mentioned that there's probably a lot of collateral effects on NotPetya.



`67 00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:22,700`
Because I mean, this were, I mean, companies also struck in Russia, so on and so on.



`68 00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,300`
Yeah, yeah, I think that like,



`69 00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:28,100`
it may mostly have been collateral damage.



`70 00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,340`
It's very hard to say it's collateral damage.



`71 00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:33,220`
You have to be a little bit inside the heads of the hackers.



`72 00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:36,700`
You have to know what they were intending to do to know what they weren't intending to do.



`73 00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:43,700`
But it seems like they probably were just targeting Ukraine, and then we're just extremely



`74 00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:47,620`
reckless about allowing the worm to spread, you know, willy nilly.



`75 00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:53,180`
That, you know, we know this was Russia, and we know that NotPetya hit Russia very badly also.



`76 00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,180`
So it's,



`77 00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,380`
it's hard to imagine that that was intentional.



`78 00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:04,580`
But we also know that the way that NotPetya was seeded out to all these victims was using this



`79 00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,500`
accounting software.



`80 00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:10,420`
And that accounting software would have had, you know, the hackers could have accessed via the



`81 00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:16,180`
accounting software, the unique tax ID numbers of all of the victims, and very easily figured out



`82 00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:21,940`
exactly who was going to be infected, and even targeted their attack if they wanted to.



`83 00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:22,380`
Yeah.



`84 00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:25,300`
And they just didn't seem to care, like, they seemed fine.



`85 00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:31,460`
Like, we just started with allowing this to just be an amazingly, like, wide spread, and indiscriminate attack.



`86 00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,960`
Yeah.



`87 00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:42,820`
So, in the end of your talk, you're also discussing the wild west mentality of this group, that impressed your boss of the day,



`88 00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,820`
Right, I tried.



`89 00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:49,660`
Once I knew, once it became clear that sandworm and this whole series of attacks with these sort of, you know, maybe a group or a network of how to be targeted, when the attack was so obvious, I was completely shocked.



`90 00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,660`
Yeah.



`91 00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,660`
Yeah.



`92 00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,660`
Yeah.



`93 00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,660`
I was completely shocked.



`94 00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:54,700`
Yeah.



`95 00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:54,740`
Yeah.



`96 00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:54,760`
Yeah.



`97 00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:54,940`
Yeah.



`98 00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:54,980`
Yeah.



`99 00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:55,100`
Yeah.



`100 00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:55,120`
Yeah.



`101 00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:55,200`
Yeah.



`102 00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:55,280`
Yeah.



`103 00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:55,300`
Yeah.



`104 00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:55,320`
Yeah.



`105 00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:55,340`
Yeah.

Tack för att du har tittat på den här videon.



`138 00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:31,300`
De kom upp med bilder och alla tyckte inte att det verkligen hände.



`139 00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:34,540`
De fick mycket kritik för att de skickade ut artikeln.



`140 00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:40,140`
De hade en insens om att om de skickade ut artiklar som gick viralt-



`141 00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:44,100`
\-"så skulle de få mer pengar. -"Jag vet inte om det."



`142 00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:48,140`
Jag tittar bara på den tekniska sidan.



`143 00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:53,180`
Vi såg aldrig prover, bilder av ett riktigt dispositiv.



`144 00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:58,300`
De hade bilder som jag trodde var en typ av mock-up.



`145 00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:02,820`
Så jag tänkte att vi skulle göra det riktigt.



`146 00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:05,940`
Vi ska försöka göra det.



`147 00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:11,060`
Som vanligt försöker jag se hur lätt något är.



`148 00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:16,580`
Kan jag göra det relativt lågt och lätt?



`149 00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:23,140`
Vi hör om 80-20-reglerna, där man får 80 % av jobbet med 20 % av utmaningen.



`150 00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:26,380`
Mina utmaningar är mer som 50-10-reglerna.



`151 00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:32,140`
Jag försöker få 50 % av jobbet gjort med 10 % av utmaningen.



`152 00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:36,500`
Då tänkte du att vi ska lägga något i något.



`153 00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:39,020`
Hur bestämde du dig för att utmana?



`154 00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:42,220`
Jag arbetar i ett industriellt kontrollsystem.



`155 00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:48,900`
Jag tittar runt på industriella appar i mitt labb som jag har tillgång till.



`156 00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:52,420`
På en viss grad bestämde jag mig för-



`157 00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:56,020`
att en serial port kan vara en lätt attack-vektor.



`158 00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:59,340`
De är nästan alla konfigurerade av serial-portar.



`159 00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:04,660`
Sen tänkte jag att, ja, den industriella kontrollsystem-världen-



`160 00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:11,700`
är ofta runnad av serial-portar, men så är det även med CISCO-vattnet och appar.



`161 00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:14,940`
Det kan ha en lite bredare uppmärksamhet.



`162 00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:19,660`
Jag började i ICS-spacet, men en serial port är en serial port.



`163 00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,500`
Jag tror att CISCO-attacken-



`164 00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,980`
hade en större uppmärksamhet.



`165 00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:28,180`
Så du öppnade upp den och började utforska-



`166 00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:31,420`
var man ska lägga in den här rysgränsen, eller hur?



`167 00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:36,300`
Den är lite större än det. Den är inte så liten-



`168 00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,340`
som den andra artikeln sa.



`169 00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,380`
En stor rysgräns.



`170 00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:46,060`
Ja, så 50 % av effekten på 10 % av kostnaden.



`171 00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:51,300`
Jag bygger inte customchips. Den är ungefär 5 mm i stund.



`172 00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,900`
Det är en liten, rysgräns.



`173 00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:57,500`
Jag öppnade inte upp så mycket och började utforska.



`174 00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:00,260`
Jag hade att testa så att det skulle fungera först.



`175 00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,780`
Jag ville följa snabbt och tajligt.



`176 00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:05,580`
Det går inte att spela mycket arbete om det inte fungerar.



`177 00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:08,740`
Det var om att testa den med andra tajta tillverkningar.



`178 00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,780`
Jag började med OONO.



`179 00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,180`
Arduino OONOs.



`180 00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:16,940`
När jag förstod att jag kunde interfacera dem och få dem att göra attacken-



`181 00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,380`
så väljde jag en mindre chip.



`182 00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,860`
Och sen så-



`183 00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,500`
I'm looking for where and how to place it.



`184 00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,940`
And how much



`185 00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,920`
in the approach that you



`186 00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,720`
made, how much hardware



`187 00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,740`
versus how much software do you need



`188 00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:33,000`
to approach



`189 00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,260`
this attack with?



`190 00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,580`
Yeah, I mean



`191 00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,060`
in retrospect



`192 00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:41,240`
I don't think



`193 00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,860`
it's very difficult for somebody



`194 00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:45,040`
with a little bit of technical



`195 00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,040`
skill in like programming Arduinos



`196 00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,400`
or using a soldering iron.



`197 00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,740`
It seems like for a lot of



`198 00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:53,020`
tasks, technical



`199 00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:55,180`
tasks, the hard thing



`200 00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,840`
is the belief that it can be done.



`201 00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,080`
And once you decide that it can be done



`202 00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,180`
it's not very difficult. And it should be



`203 00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:03,240`
easy if you want to follow along and do this



`204 00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:03,820`
on your own.



`205 00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,420`
The hardware is an ATtiny



`206 00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,560`
85 chip.



`207 00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,340`
You can program it with the Arduino IDE



`208 00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:13,420`
environment. And the software



`209 00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,360`
basically just sends a set



`210 00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,060`
of commands that you can



`211 00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,020`
follow along from a Cisco



`212 00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,580`
password recovery document.



`213 00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,620`
So if you can print



`214 00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,680`
to a serial port, that's the



`215 00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,720`
software. And



`216 00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,400`
with just a little bit of



`217 00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,480`
fiddling, if you can



`218 00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,540`
wire up that hardware



`219 00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,680`
chip to the motherboard, you can send



`220 00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,660`
those commands on reboot when they're needed.



`221 00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,680`
So the implant itself is



`222 00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,600`
something that you pick up in any hardware



`223 00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,680`
store, or not hardware



`224 00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,100`
store, but an electronic store



`225 00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,220`
on town, right?



`226 00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,920`
Yeah, you know, China's my favorite



`227 00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,720`
hardware provider.



`228 00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,580`
And I think there's some irony



`229 00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:54,600`
in using cheap Chinese equipment to



`230 00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,680`
build this implant.



`231 00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,260`
Now you can get these



`232 00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,700`
from Amazon. I'm



`233 00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:03,000`
using the Digispark



`234 00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,540`
board, which has the small



`235 00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:06,660`
processor on it. And I'm programming



`236 00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,640`
it on that board and then desoldering



`237 00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,620`
it from there and soldering it



`238 00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,360`
onto the Cisco



`239 00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,260`
motherboard.



`240 00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,600`
They're $2 US



`241 00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,640`
each, so the hardware



`242 00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,460`
is not expensive.



`243 00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,400`
The software is not that



`244 00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,480`
difficult. You spend a little



`245 00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,600`
time looking around the best way to install



`246 00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,540`
it. Again, I think the key is



`247 00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,540`
just knowing that it can be done.



`248 00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,260`
And then go for it, right?



`249 00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:32,540`
Yeah.



`250 00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:36,020`
That's quite amazing. And I mean,



`251 00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,520`
you got a lot of attention around



`252 00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,080`
when you put out the article



`253 00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,440`
and the spin



`254 00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,860`
went quite viral



`255 00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:46,280`
in itself, that you could actually



`256 00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,120`
do this kind of attack.



`257 00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,240`
What's the response been



`258 00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:50,580`
from



`259 00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,880`
the others?



`260 00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:55,260`
Well,



`261 00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,160`
one of the most interesting things



`262 00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,320`
for me is



`263 00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:02,400`
using my Android phone



`264 00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,180`
and occasionally, more than once,



`265 00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,300`
I have popped up on my own news feed.



`266 00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:07,940`
And there's something when



`267 00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,580`
I open it up and I see



`268 00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,880`
somebody has quoted me



`269 00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,520`
in my news feed. It's like, oh wow, that's



`270 00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,340`
interesting. That doesn't happen to me



`271 00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:16,760`
every day.



`272 00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:20,500`
But I mean, if we say Cisco



`273 00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,380`
for instance, have they replied



`274 00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:22,960`
in any way?



`275 00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,040`
Cisco called me.



`276 00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,100`
That's a sort of very



`277 00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,280`
interesting question is



`278 00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,020`
whether or not this is a vulnerability.



`279 00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,300`
I didn't think it was. I didn't talk to



`280 00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,500`
them originally if I thought it was a vulnerability.



`281 00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,340`
And after some discussion



`282 00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,360`
with them, they decided that it's



`283 00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,400`
not a vulnerability.



`284 00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:44,080`
It uses an existing



`285 00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,360`
feature in the devices that would allow



`286 00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,020`
you to recover passwords.



`287 00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,240`
The normal fault, though, is that you have to



`288 00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,220`
physically be present in front of the



`289 00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,660`
device and plugged into it.



`290 00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,220`
My twist is leaving a chip behind that



`291 00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,360`
can do that later on.



`292 00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,760`
I think that



`293 00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:02,200`
although we don't consider that



`294 00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,600`
a vulnerability now,



`295 00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,860`
that in the future, maybe



`296 00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,940`
five years from now,



`297 00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,840`
some of this



`298 00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,280`
unauthenticated local



`299 00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,280`
physical access might be



`300 00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,080`
considered a vulnerability just as we



`301 00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,060`
evolve our understanding



`302 00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:20,080`
of what vulnerabilities and security is



`303 00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:20,580`
over time.



`304 00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:24,240`
It's not about being physically present



`305 00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,080`
in the place where you approach



`306 00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,020`
it, right? It's a supply chain that's



`307 00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,920`
interesting. Can you intercept



`308 00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,100`
it while it's delivered to that



`309 00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,880`
factory or anything else?



`310 00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,980`
Yeah, and frankly, that's



`311 00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:36,740`
the hard part.



`312 00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,960`
We get a lot of play about building the



`313 00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,060`
device. The hard part would be introducing



`314 00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,980`
it in the supply chain. I could



`315 00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,100`
do small numbers, perhaps.



`316 00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,000`
I could resell these devices on



`317 00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,880`
eBay. Maybe



`318 00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,060`
I could social engineer my way



`319 00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:54,020`
into a site and replace a



`320 00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,200`
device or provide a device.



`321 00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,920`
But that would be



`322 00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,860`
hard to do on



`323 00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:02,080`
a large scale. The hardware



`324 00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,780`
part is easy. I think probably



`325 00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,780`
the supply chain interdiction is



`326 00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,880`
the harder task.



`327 00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,920`
But once you get a foothold there in some way,



`328 00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,040`
that's also a soft spot



`329 00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,820`
for the asset owner



`330 00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:15,980`
because you trust what you're getting



`331 00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:18,040`
in the original package,



`332 00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,780`
so to speak. You just open it up.



`333 00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,600`
It has all the manuals and



`334 00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,040`
everything in the box, right?



`335 00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,840`
So why should you worry about



`336 00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,560`
that it has a latent



`337 00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,640`
implant



`338 00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,700`
device installed?



`339 00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,260`
Yeah, and I have



`340 00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:35,680`
my secret weapon, which is



`341 00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,620`
sort of supply chain



`342 00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,700`
jujitsu, where I have



`343 00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,720`
some very nice warranty void



`344 00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,920`
if removed stickers. They have holograms



`345 00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,820`
on them. They have barcodes and serial



`346 00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,820`
numbers. And if you put one of those on a



`347 00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,860`
device after chipping it, some



`348 00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,840`
body is a little more hesitant



`349 00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,780`
to peel it off and open it up and



`350 00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,760`
take the motherboard out and turn it over and look



`351 00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,760`
to see if there's anything that looks a little weird



`352 00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,660`
on there. Exactly, so you hide



`353 00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,400`
your implant in that



`354 00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,360`
sense. Yes,



`355 00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,160`
but right now



`356 00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,700`
you have to take 14 screws



`357 00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,720`
out, pull the motherboard out, turn it upside



`358 00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,560`
down and look. And



`359 00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,780`
I think in general people are hesitant



`360 00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,360`
to do that. If they were going to buy



`361 00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,840`
new security equipment,



`362 00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,620`
they'd probably maybe take the



`363 00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,460`
case off when you have technical people, but



`364 00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:23,580`
actually have to pull the motherboard out and turn it



`365 00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,480`
upside down is, I'd say,



`366 00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,480`
a little more than people are comfortable with



`367 00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,800`
in general, for new equipment especially.



`368 00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,940`
Yeah, I mean, it's



`369 00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,640`
all coming back to the threat



`370 00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,360`
modeling then, I guess. I mean,



`371 00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,480`
if it's



`372 00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,700`
some factory



`373 00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,700`
with non-crucial parts or if



`374 00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,580`
it's a nuclear facility that you're



`375 00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:45,140`
putting this stuff into,



`376 00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,600`
I guess you have different threat models



`377 00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,600`
to take



`378 00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,880`
into account in that sense.



`379 00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:53,420`
Yeah, and there's actually a good place



`380 00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:55,640`
to hide it inside the connector



`381 00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,560`
where you would plug



`382 00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,340`
in this RJ45 connection



`383 00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,780`
for the serial cable, so



`384 00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,540`
with that in mind, you might actually be able



`385 00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,460`
to attack the



`386 00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,440`
supply chain of the supplier. In other



`387 00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,720`
words, if you're providing those



`388 00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,680`
sockets, those RF-shielded



`389 00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,400`
cans, you could



`390 00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,300`
put the chip in there



`391 00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,500`
and then sell it to the



`392 00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,880`
manufacturer, be it



`393 00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,660`
Cisco or others.



`394 00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,720`
And by the way, this isn't, I mean,



`395 00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,720`
it uses the Cisco recovery documents



`396 00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,580`
and I'm doing it in that place, but



`397 00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,340`
they just happen to



`398 00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,320`
be the lucky winner



`399 00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,040`
for picking a device.



`400 00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,540`
It's largely



`401 00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,680`
applicable to anything that has



`402 00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,020`
a serial configuration port.



`403 00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,480`
Yeah, that's cool.



`404 00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:43,520`
If we round off this small



`405 00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,520`
teaser, so to speak,



`406 00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,260`
you will be available on the



`407 00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:49,360`
RCS3 YouTube channel,



`408 00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,440`
once it's online, the presentation that you give



`409 00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,480`
for all the people that are interested



`410 00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,180`
in the details.



`411 00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:57,480`
You have your own YouTube channel that you



`412 00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,920`
could plug again? Yeah, yeah.



`413 00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:02,000`
Look for Monte Elkins, M-O-N-T-A



`414 00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,460`
Elkins, E-L-K-I-N-S



`415 00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:05,760`
Coke and Strippers



`416 00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,540`
on YouTube.



`417 00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,660`
And in a few



`418 00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,160`
months, I should be doing this



`419 00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,620`
presentation again in the U.S. if you're not



`420 00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,020`
able to get out there.



`421 00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,660`
TDI Technologies sponsored



`422 00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,580`
my trip to the SANS ICS,



`423 00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,800`
Summit, and if you want to come by



`424 00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,180`
and see it in person and



`425 00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:25,620`
more details perhaps than you can



`426 00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,680`
get here, look for



`427 00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,380`
that. I believe that's in March of



`428 00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,380`
2020. Oh, excellent.



`429 00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,980`
So the next possible



`430 00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:35,420`
spot to spot you, so to speak.



`431 00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,580`
Yeah, yeah. That's cool. Okay, so on



`432 00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,600`
behalf of the Secrets Podcast and listeners, I thank you



`433 00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,820`
Monte for being on the show, and



`434 00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,520`
I hope you have a nice day



`435 00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,500`
here in Stockholm and following up



`436 00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,060`
on this one, and



`437 00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,260`
this is Robin from PostSpeaking.



`438 00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,800`
Thank you for tuning in to Secrets Podcast



`439 00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,640`
and once again, thank you all.



`440 00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,080`
Thank you.



`441 00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,940`
Welcome to Secrets Podcast



`442 00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,480`
and transmitting from



`443 00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,880`
CS3 Stockholm



`444 00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,900`
2019. We just



`445 00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,580`
got off stage here. This is



`446 00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,240`
Robin from PostSpeaking, and



`447 00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,760`
on the other side of the table, I have



`448 00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,480`
Steven Hilt from Trend Micro.



`449 00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,280`
Welcome. Thank you.



`450 00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,580`
So you had a really interesting



`451 00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,960`
talk here about



`452 00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,580`
hacking crane.



`453 00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,680`
So the remote controls of



`454 00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,780`
construction cranes, right?



`455 00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,660`
Yeah, it focused the



`456 00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,340`
presentation because we have the crane,



`457 00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,680`
but it applies to many of the industrial



`458 00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,680`
radios that control lots of other things



`459 00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,180`
than just cranes themselves.



`460 00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,040`
That's really cool. And



`461 00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,700`
what was the basic



`462 00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,740`
interest, or how did you get this basic



`463 00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,600`
interest for this research



`464 00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,620`
that you did? Yeah, so originally



`465 00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:45,600`
we were pitching ideas for



`466 00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,080`
research as we do



`467 00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,520`
yearly, and a couple



`468 00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,500`
of us got together, and



`469 00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,500`
one of my co-workers, Federico,



`470 00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,580`
in Italy, had



`471 00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:57,480`
noticed a construction crane across



`472 00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,360`
from his house, and started wondering



`473 00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,200`
to himself,



`474 00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:03,440`
are these things vulnerable? Are



`475 00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,540`
they secure? How does the communications



`476 00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,540`
work? Things like that. And so when



`477 00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,400`
we were talking about it, you know, we



`478 00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,360`
had noticed the same things, and



`479 00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,960`
lots of us,



`480 00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:15,400`
in total seven people on our team



`481 00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,400`
that did this project, got



`482 00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,440`
together and decided that we wanted



`483 00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,280`
to look at the security



`484 00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,920`
if there was any



`485 00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,540`
on the controllers



`486 00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,700`
for large construction



`487 00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,480`
cranes was the original piece.



`488 00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,400`
And once we started digging into it, we



`489 00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,560`
found more and more systems



`490 00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,380`
that utilize the same



`491 00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:37,420`
communications. And how many



`492 00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:39,620`
different vendors or different brands



`493 00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:41,440`
are you looking at? We looked at



`494 00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,660`
seven vendors that were



`495 00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,720`
globally dispersed between



`496 00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,300`
multiple countries



`497 00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,420`
and where the



`498 00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,940`
point of origin of the country is



`499 00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:53,720`
manufactured. From Taiwan,



`500 00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,380`
there was even a vendor



`501 00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,640`
from Sweden, Italy, US,



`502 00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:59,180`
and Japan.



`503 00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,440`
So this is a global



`504 00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,440`
issue, so to speak?



`505 00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,580`
Yeah, out of the seven vendors we looked at,



`506 00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:07,500`
all of them were susceptible to



`507 00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,460`
easy replay attacks.



`508 00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,480`
That's quite amazing, right?



`509 00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,500`
I mean, what did you think



`510 00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,120`
when you figured that out?



`511 00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,540`
When we had



`512 00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:19,420`
conversations, and we originally found this,



`513 00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,540`
going back



`514 00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,400`
to Federico, I was



`515 00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,600`
more surprised that his garage



`516 00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,620`
door has more security



`517 00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,540`
than, because



`518 00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:30,320`
they have no



`519 00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:33,540`
implementation of rolling codes when we



`520 00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:34,920`
looked at it, or any security



`521 00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,860`
when we looked at those specific



`522 00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:38,860`
vendors.



`523 00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,480`
Because in your talk you said



`524 00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,400`
you had an escalating



`525 00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,460`
approach to just



`526 00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:47,600`
start by replaying, then start to try to figure



`527 00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,380`
out the general commands,



`528 00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,560`
to send to it. I mean, you could have stopped



`529 00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,640`
just by doing the replay, and



`530 00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:56,060`
this is too bad, right?



`531 00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:57,740`
Yeah, we could,



`532 00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,420`
but one of the things we wanted to do,



`533 00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,540`
because replay does take you recording



`534 00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:04,040`
messages of the crane in operation,



`535 00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,840`
so we wanted to prove that



`536 00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,960`
an attacker could pre-plan something,



`537 00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,180`
record it, be able



`538 00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:11,940`
to figure out the communications and how the



`539 00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:14,060`
protocol works, come back, and



`540 00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:16,020`
issue commands that you may not have issued



`541 00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:16,720`
that they recorded.



`542 00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,340`
And you could carry the



`543 00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:21,600`
transmitter on like a drone or



`544 00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,760`
anything, I guess, because it's not a



`545 00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,820`
huge effect that you need



`546 00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:26,700`
to transmit on.



`547 00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:29,620`
No, a drone, but we also



`548 00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:31,840`
built a tool called RFQuack



`549 00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,320`
that



`550 00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:35,880`
you can deploy



`551 00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,740`
the device, it can run



`552 00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,560`
on a battery, it has wifi



`553 00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:41,800`
and cellular capabilities



`554 00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,680`
to remotely get into the



`555 00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,960`
device, listen, and then also transmit



`556 00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:46,940`
as well.



`557 00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:49,240`
And the reason why we did that



`558 00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,780`
was to just show that



`559 00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:53,060`
you always hear that in practice



`560 00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:55,160`
you have to be near it, you have to



`561 00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:57,100`
do all these things, but now we built a device



`562 00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:59,300`
that we can remotely deploy, and then



`563 00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,240`
get into later and make our attack



`564 00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,560`
from even further away.



`565 00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:04,440`
On a safe distance, right?



`566 00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,760`
So what was the



`567 00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:09,100`
response from the vendors



`568 00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:10,040`
when you approached them?



`569 00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,220`
We dove into that



`570 00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:15,480`
during the talk a bunch,



`571 00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:16,800`
and I don't want to spoil



`572 00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,220`
too much for those



`573 00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:20,900`
who are going to watch it when it comes on



`574 00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:22,800`
YouTube, but the



`575 00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,900`
response was more or



`576 00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:26,620`
less, we



`577 00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:28,640`
only had one vendor who never



`578 00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,960`
responded to us. Three of the



`579 00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,560`
seven vendors have



`580 00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:33,960`
issued patches,



`581 00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,800`
and the other ones addressed it



`582 00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,660`
by either saying that the product is into



`583 00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:40,720`
life, or other



`584 00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,800`
reasons why it



`585 00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:43,680`
couldn't be fixed.



`586 00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:46,780`
So, I mean, given



`587 00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:48,560`
your insight into this,



`588 00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,360`
all the protocols and the details,



`589 00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:52,620`
and as you said, the details will be



`590 00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:54,300`
on the YouTube channel from CS3



`591 00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,100`
later this year,



`592 00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,120`
what would you say,



`593 00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,940`
would be the recommendations



`594 00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:02,620`
to a typical manufacturer



`595 00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:04,180`
of a remote-controlled



`596 00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:06,100`
facility?



`597 00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,600`
So, recommendations are, we need



`598 00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,580`
to look



`599 00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:12,180`
at sub-gigahertz



`600 00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:14,640`
radio communications to make



`601 00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,660`
sure not only that in these cases



`602 00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:18,420`
of industrial radios that



`603 00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:20,420`
for specifics that we were talking about were



`604 00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:22,760`
cranes, make sure



`605 00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,760`
that these kinds of security issues



`606 00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,620`
are getting fixed now before they become



`607 00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:28,520`
a really big problem



`608 00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,700`
as radio equipment



`609 00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:32,520`
becomes cheaper and cheaper, and



`610 00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,480`
people have the ability



`611 00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,780`
to buy



`612 00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:38,880`
it and use it with software-defined radios



`613 00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,580`
becoming more



`614 00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:41,220`
and more prevalent.



`615 00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,660`
That sounds like a good plan.



`616 00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,680`
And I mean, looking at, as you



`617 00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,300`
said, like key fobs for cars



`618 00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:50,360`
and garage doors, etc., I mean, there is



`619 00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:52,040`
some advances in cryptography



`620 00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,000`
and in basic design



`621 00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,400`
that they could just adopt, I guess.



`622 00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:58,000`
Yes, yeah, they could.



`623 00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:00,260`
The only thing is,



`624 00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,420`
and I explained that



`625 00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:04,260`
I had a conversation with somebody here



`626 00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:06,200`
at the conference about this, and they're like,



`627 00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:08,460`
but why does my garage door have that



`628 00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:10,560`
when these don't? And it's because



`629 00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,280`
people break into



`630 00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:14,220`
people's houses using replay



`631 00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:16,180`
attacks previously. There's been



`632 00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:16,640`
no



`633 00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,480`
proof or anything like that, a



`634 00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,560`
wide-scale issue on



`635 00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,000`
these systems has happened.



`636 00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:24,560`
And we don't want to wait until something happens



`637 00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,600`
to fix it, so we need to try



`638 00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,520`
to plan before the



`639 00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:30,660`
attackers really start going after these



`640 00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:32,480`
communication



`641 00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,300`
protocols to



`642 00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:36,740`
go ahead and get that security added to it.



`643 00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:38,780`
That's excellent.



`644 00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,580`
I think being on the toes instead of



`645 00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:42,000`
the heels is a good



`646 00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,420`
strategy for them, since, I mean,



`647 00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,420`
it's not toys we're talking.



`648 00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:47,820`
No, no.



`649 00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:49,200`
This is real stuff.



`650 00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:51,680`
Yeah, and that's one of the reasons why in the presentation



`651 00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,600`
I showed a video of us moving



`652 00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,300`
a large



`653 00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:58,180`
real crane and not just the toy one



`654 00:46:58,180 --> 00:46:58,660`
on stage.



`655 00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:02,240`
It sounds like a critical



`656 00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,960`
infrastructure that I don't want



`657 00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,580`
anyone else to replay or



`658 00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:07,660`
toy around with in that sense.



`659 00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,180`
So the RF Quark, is that



`660 00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:12,260`
possible to look into?



`661 00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:13,800`
Yeah, it is



`662 00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,960`
publicly available on GitHub.



`663 00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,280`
The code to run it is



`664 00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:20,360`
on Trend Micro's GitHub



`665 00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:22,380`
page. That's cool. So you search



`666 00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:23,880`
for RF Quark



`667 00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,660`
and then you're done.



`668 00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,380`
And it'll show up in the board



`669 00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:29,920`
schematics and how to build it.



`670 00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:31,960`
Everything is there on the GitHub page.



`671 00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,560`
Excellent. Let's keep the



`672 00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,340`
crane remote controls on



`673 00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:38,260`
the toes, right? Yeah. Okay, Stephen.



`674 00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,460`
Thank you so much for sharing with



`675 00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:42,560`
Secrets Podcasten. A small



`676 00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,300`
teaser for the presentation that you



`677 00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:46,440`
gave and will be on the YouTube channel



`678 00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,260`
later this year. My pleasure



`679 00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:50,000`
and thanks for having me. Thank you for coming.



`680 00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:52,500`
Take care. All right. This is



`681 00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,340`
Security Podcast Secrets



`682 00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:56,360`
Podcasten. I'm now from



`683 00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:58,320`
CS3 Stockholm and



`684 00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,360`
I am very honored



`685 00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:02,180`
to have Jimmy Wiley



`686 00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:03,900`
and Reid Reitman



`687 00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:05,660`
from Dragos



`688 00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:08,460`
who just delivered a talk on



`689 00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:12,120`
security research into



`690 00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,240`
PLCs.



`691 00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,380`
I thought it



`692 00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:18,200`
was a pretty interesting talk



`693 00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:20,400`
specifically since you were



`694 00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,060`
looking at



`695 00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:24,360`
a particular problem and



`696 00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,940`
wanted to find out if that



`697 00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:28,260`
applied to other PLCs.



`698 00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,320`
Could you just, for our



`699 00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,180`
listeners, because they probably haven't seen



`700 00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:34,060`
the talk, could you just do the



`701 00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:36,220`
elevator pitch on what it was



`702 00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:38,300`
about? Yeah, so we looked at this



`703 00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:40,460`
trisis attack that affected



`704 00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:42,220`
the Triconic safety controller



`705 00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:44,720`
a few years ago at a



`706 00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,300`
gas plant in Saudi



`707 00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:48,180`
Arabia and we just wanted to know



`708 00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:50,200`
would the



`709 00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:52,220`
vulnerability or the issue that was



`710 00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:54,520`
used in that attack affect other



`711 00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:56,240`
vendors' controllers?



`712 00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:57,520`
In other words, could they



`713 00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,960`
take what's a normal



`714 00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:02,140`
operation by an engineer and



`715 00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:04,440`
cause the entire controller to become



`716 00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:06,180`
untrusted? So we



`717 00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:07,920`
wanted to look at a few different control



`718 00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,080`
vendors and see if they might be impacted



`719 00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,060`
by the same issue. And that



`720 00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:14,200`
particular malware



`721 00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,060`
was sort of like a root



`722 00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:17,620`
kit for PLCs, right?



`723 00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:20,040`
Yeah, so the



`724 00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,180`
main thing here is



`725 00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:23,560`
arbitrary code execution.



`726 00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:25,960`
Can we achieve arbitrary code



`727 00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,900`
execution? That is step one. So understand



`728 00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:30,220`
the protocol, understand the code format



`729 00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:31,920`
and then once you have the code, examine the



`730 00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,760`
privilege on the device



`731 00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,860`
and see whether or not an exploit



`732 00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:37,320`
is necessary to do anything else.



`733 00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,680`
So with trisis, they needed



`734 00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:42,120`
privilege, supervisor privilege



`735 00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,940`
in order to install a root kit because in order



`736 00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:46,000`
to achieve persistence, they need to be in a



`737 00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,960`
particular part of firmware memory which would have



`738 00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:49,940`
been inaccessible as a sort of



`739 00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:52,020`
regular quote-unquote user program.



`740 00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:52,780`
Yeah, yeah.



`741 00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,200`
And that, the



`742 00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,740`
possibility



`743 00:49:57,740 --> 00:49:59,920`
to do an attack



`744 00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,760`
like that, it's also very



`745 00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,860`
dependent on the type of processor, right?



`746 00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,140`
I mean, if



`747 00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:07,760`
you look at older



`748 00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,820`
types of processors that



`749 00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:11,840`
do not separate between



`750 00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:12,500`
user



`751 00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:15,220`
execution



`752 00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:15,940`
and



`753 00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:18,440`
ring zero execution



`754 00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:19,420`
and so on and so forth.



`755 00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:21,140`
Yeah, certainly some older processors



`756 00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:23,760`
you saw on the talk, you know, there are PLCs



`757 00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,740`
that use these old CPUs that don't



`758 00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:28,020`
even have this concept of separating



`759 00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:29,960`
user code from supervisor



`760 00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,840`
code. So all code



`761 00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:32,660`
is treated equally.



`762 00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,420`
And that makes it easier.



`763 00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:36,600`
Right, for sure.



`764 00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:40,040`
Yeah, because it means arbitrary code execution



`765 00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:40,620`
is winning.



`766 00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:43,880`
As opposed to needing to do an exploit afterwards,



`767 00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,880`
right? So it would have been like steps one and two of trisis.



`768 00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:47,580`
And then it would have been over with, right?



`769 00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:49,700`
Yeah, and that's, I mean, that's basically



`770 00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:51,820`
what our talk was. How do we get steps one and two?



`771 00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:53,920`
And then once we have steps one and two,



`772 00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:55,760`
you know, then step three, we could



`773 00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,780`
do if we wanted to like sit there and play with it.



`774 00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,720`
But that's not as important as how easy it is



`775 00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:02,000`
just to get our code to execute.



`776 00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:03,000`
Right, right.



`777 00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,500`
What would you say,



`778 00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:07,580`
I mean, when you



`779 00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:09,760`
point out this problem to the



`780 00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,640`
vendors, you



`781 00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,620`
sort of received the same question on stage



`782 00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:15,060`
now, but would you say



`783 00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:17,840`
that information is received



`784 00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,800`
well, or are you treated



`785 00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,220`
sort of like...



`786 00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:23,340`
It's been pretty neutral, I would say. It's not



`787 00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:25,740`
an issue that a lot of vendors have considered



`788 00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:27,660`
in the past. And, you know, I totally understand



`789 00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:29,800`
that, honestly. As a researcher, I'm like, well,



`790 00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,280`
you know, I used to work for a vendor,



`791 00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:33,740`
and I know, you know, back then, that



`792 00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:35,900`
was not a design consideration. It was just



`793 00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:37,360`
that's how it works.



`794 00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:39,680`
You know, that went into



`795 00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:40,820`
the product design. So,



`796 00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:43,740`
you know, it's kind of a little



`797 00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:45,720`
give and take with the vendor, because you have



`798 00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:47,600`
to understand that the product



`799 00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,720`
wasn't designed that way to have this



`800 00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:50,820`
separation of code.



`801 00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,180`
They're not going to fix it overnight.



`802 00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:55,700`
In fact, they're probably not going to fix it at



`803 00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:57,500`
all in the current generation



`804 00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,780`
products. It's probably going to be something



`805 00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:01,520`
that requires years of development



`806 00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,620`
effort internally, and they're really only



`807 00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,600`
going to go down that path if their customers ask



`808 00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,660`
for it. You know, I can



`809 00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:09,700`
kick and scream all I want. They're probably not going to listen



`810 00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:11,580`
to me, ultimately. I'll have to mention



`811 00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:13,640`
the original design consideration was



`812 00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:15,600`
like, they only assumed



`813 00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,400`
that their software is generating the code that will



`814 00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,620`
execute. Like, that is



`815 00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:21,680`
part of the assumption. That's the assumption



`816 00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,680`
we're trying to break, but that's the assumption they're operating



`817 00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,500`
under. So, they're not really thinking



`818 00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:27,920`
like, oh, well, this isn't like a



`819 00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,560`
web browser situation where



`820 00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:31,520`
you're always downloading code. Anytime you go



`821 00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,480`
to any website, you're downloading code into your box, and



`822 00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:34,400`
it's executing, right?



`823 00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,660`
And you trust that everything's going to happen safely



`824 00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:39,260`
except for the one time it gets away from you.



`825 00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:41,280`
And the vendors,



`826 00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,480`
they don't think that way.



`827 00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,560`
They don't think like, oh, you know, my controller



`828 00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,580`
will execute code from any place. My code is



`829 00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:49,500`
only going to execute from things that I already



`830 00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:50,800`
wrote and formatted correctly.



`831 00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:53,480`
Yeah, I totally understand.



`832 00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:55,560`
I mean, it's, taking



`833 00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:56,920`
the example from



`834 00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:59,560`
the thing I will



`835 00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:00,460`
talk about tomorrow,



`836 00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:03,600`
I discovered a



`837 00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,660`
serious flaw in the security



`838 00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:07,060`
architecture of



`839 00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:09,020`
a SCADA component.



`840 00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:11,460`
And that



`841 00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:13,200`
was, you know,



`842 00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:15,380`
almost impossible to get



`843 00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:17,340`
the vendor first to accept that this was



`844 00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:19,180`
a huge problem. So, I



`845 00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:21,280`
wrote a proof of concept code, and then it



`846 00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,100`
dawned on them, and it's like, this is



`847 00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:25,300`
damn bad. And then they



`848 00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:26,160`
tried to bury it.



`849 00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:26,420`
Yeah.



`850 00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:29,980`
And, I mean,



`851 00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:32,320`
it's, yeah.



`852 00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:34,140`
Don't sign the NDA.



`853 00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:36,340`
No, no. And also,



`854 00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:37,520`
also, I mean,



`855 00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:40,400`
the tail end of that problem



`856 00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,240`
is that there's



`857 00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:43,940`
going to be customers out there with



`858 00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:45,320`
vulnerable PLCs,



`859 00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:47,240`
vulnerable SCADA systems, vulnerable



`860 00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:49,320`
this and that. And



`861 00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:51,240`
they have a, you know,



`862 00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:53,420`
life cycle of over



`863 00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:55,260`
10, 15 years.



`864 00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:57,300`
So, even if the



`865 00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,460`
vendor comes out with a new product that is not



`866 00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:01,080`
vulnerable, I mean, it's going to take



`867 00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:03,340`
for ages before the



`868 00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:04,560`
customers are secure.



`869 00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:07,300`
I mean, it'll probably be five years before we even see



`870 00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:09,440`
a product that considers this particular design



`871 00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,340`
flaw as part of its



`872 00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:13,400`
design model. So, the PLCs



`873 00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:15,340`
that are being vetted and installed for



`874 00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:17,300`
the next five years will have this



`875 00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:18,500`
problem, most likely.



`876 00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:21,440`
And then they'll be around for another 20 or 30



`877 00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:22,920`
beyond that. So, it's, yeah.



`878 00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:25,080`
I'll probably be retired by the time



`879 00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:27,240`
security can,



`880 00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:29,360`
but by the time these things become,



`881 00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:31,440`
you know, commonplace where you have



`882 00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,340`
a, you know, controller that's



`883 00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:35,360`
running code in a



`884 00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:36,580`
secure enclave somehow.



`885 00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:39,500`
I think, but that's,



`886 00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:41,300`
I don't want, well, that's not an okay problem. I mean, that's a



`887 00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:43,360`
problem, but that's part of the reason why we're doing



`888 00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,200`
this work. We know that these



`889 00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,220`
things aren't going to get fixed. And as much as we want



`890 00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:49,240`
to complain to Rockwell or whoever, well, not



`891 00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:51,260`
Rockwell necessarily yet, but, you know,



`892 00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:53,480`
Proconos or Codasys or whatever about these problems,



`893 00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:55,380`
that's not why we started doing this, right?



`894 00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,300`
So, it was two things, right? One,



`895 00:54:58,760 --> 00:54:59,320`
what is it going



`896 00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:01,280`
to take? Like, what is, after



`897 00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,160`
Tricis, we got a lot of questions. You know,



`898 00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:05,180`
what do you think the level of effort would have been to do this



`899 00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:07,240`
with the Triconics? Like, how long would it have taken you



`900 00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,200`
all to do it? Which is already, like, kind of a loaded question



`901 00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,120`
because, you know, I've been doing RE for



`902 00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:13,160`
10 years. He's been doing ICS stuff for 10 or



`903 00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:15,080`
15 years. You're looking at two people that have lots of



`904 00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:17,120`
experience and asking them how long it'll take. Well, I don't



`905 00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:19,080`
know. Like, their team could have taken less or



`906 00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:20,560`
more time depending on who was on it.



`907 00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,160`
And so, for us, it's like, well, how do



`908 00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:25,200`
we, like, how do we actually understand the level



`909 00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,120`
of effort to get from, you know, point A to point



`910 00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:29,120`
B, right? Without the help of



`911 00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:31,120`
the vendor. Like, I don't want to talk to them. I don't want them giving me



`912 00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:33,260`
any hints because, you know, ideally the attacker,



`913 00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:34,980`
you know, in the worst case,



`914 00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:36,580`
the attacker has no help, right?



`915 00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:39,180`
And then, the sort of second part



`916 00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:40,840`
of this, you know, so there's the understanding



`917 00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:43,140`
what it takes to actually execute



`918 00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:45,060`
one of these attacks. The sort



`919 00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:47,120`
of second part is, we know that this thing isn't



`920 00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:48,820`
going to get fixed necessarily right away.



`921 00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:51,080`
Understanding the first



`922 00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:53,280`
part lets us build detections



`923 00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,980`
and analytics on the second part. So,



`924 00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:57,140`
it doesn't matter if you



`925 00:55:57,140 --> 00:55:59,120`
get it, well, I mean, it does matter, but it doesn't matter if an attack



`926 00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:01,140`
comes through on the wire because the fact is we have a way to detect



`927 00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:03,260`
it, we have a way to detect a code upload, and we have a way to analyze



`928 00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:05,240`
a code that gets uploaded. Right. So, we can sort things



`929 00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:07,160`
out ourselves and the incident responders can do the job



`930 00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:09,180`
that they're supposed to do, right? And that's really what we're



`931 00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:10,000`
trying to get at here.



`932 00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:13,340`
I mean, personally, I didn't even think to contact



`933 00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:15,020`
Rockwell for anything when I was doing my work.



`934 00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:15,880`
Like, why bother?



`935 00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:18,940`
And also, it would just spoil the fun.



`936 00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:20,120`
Yeah, exactly.



`937 00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:23,200`
Take away some of the



`938 00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,060`
engineering problems.



`939 00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:26,120`
Absolutely, yeah.



`940 00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:29,020`
But, I mean, what would you



`941 00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:30,920`
say, how should



`942 00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:32,400`
the end customers



`943 00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,740`
deal with this? Because it is



`944 00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:37,200`
a problem that is probably



`945 00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,080`
out



`946 00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:41,060`
there, regardless if it says



`947 00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:43,360`
ABB, Rockwell, Honeywell,



`948 00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:44,320`
whatever.



`949 00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:47,180`
Yeah. Mitsubishi



`950 00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:48,860`
on the equipment.



`951 00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,380`
Right. I hate to say perimeter



`952 00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:53,280`
protection, but perimeter protection, especially



`953 00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,280`
around the controllers, you know, make some



`954 00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,340`
firewall rules that basically say, here are



`955 00:56:57,340 --> 00:56:59,460`
my engineering workstations. They are allowed



`956 00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:01,520`
to communicate with the PLCs using



`957 00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,400`
these ports. And, I mean, part of our talk



`958 00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:05,540`
was listing, you know, what ports and services



`959 00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:07,260`
are associated with Codasys and



`960 00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:09,420`
Poconos. So, you know, you can at least take that



`961 00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:11,440`
list and say, okay, let my engineering workstations



`962 00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,440`
talk to the PLC on those ports. Deny



`963 00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,040`
everything else, and if I see anything else, try to deny it.



`964 00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:17,200`
Try to use those services on the PLC. I want to know about it.



`965 00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,140`
Flag it. Yeah. Again,



`966 00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:21,040`
that's not foolproof, though, right? No.



`967 00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,920`
Because we saw, like, in the



`968 00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:24,820`
Trisys case, the attacker



`969 00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:26,880`
had access to the engineering workstation.



`970 00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:28,940`
So, at that point, it really becomes



`971 00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:31,040`
network monitoring. You know, look for the



`972 00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,980`
abnormal behavior. Like, if we can



`973 00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:34,840`
get to the point where we are



`974 00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:36,880`
parsing the file that's being transferred



`975 00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,700`
and can actually analyze that file,



`976 00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:41,020`
that would be awesome. Yeah. Because then we could



`977 00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:43,100`
actually, you know, okay, now we have passive detection.



`978 00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:44,880`
Yes, that came from the



`979 00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:47,120`
engineering workstation, and yes, it was a



`980 00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:49,100`
logic update, but it happens to be



`981 00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:51,200`
a malicious logic update, or at least a suspicious



`982 00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,340`
one. This is something that your, you know,



`983 00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:55,020`
ICS SOC analyst



`984 00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:57,080`
wants to dig into. Yeah. Go talk to the



`985 00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:59,300`
engineer, see if he actually initiated that update,



`986 00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:01,140`
make sure that the time



`987 00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:02,760`
window fits, and all that. Exactly.



`988 00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,840`
I mean, and it's, when I



`989 00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:06,320`
used to work for



`990 00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:08,240`
a public



`991 00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:11,020`
critical infrastructure



`992 00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:13,100`
company as an IT manager,



`993 00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:15,040`
and I had the



`994 00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:16,660`
notion that I wanted,



`995 00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:19,080`
I want to know if there is



`996 00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:21,260`
a software update, regardless if it's



`997 00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:22,840`
approved or not. Yeah.



`998 00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:24,540`
So I want to know that.



`999 00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:27,060`
Because then I can go back to the



`1000 00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:29,300`
automation engineers



`1001 00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:31,240`
and say, did you guys do this?



`1002 00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:32,720`
Right. Yes or no? Right.



`1003 00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:34,680`
And then, you know,



`1004 00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,020`
in all the cases, the answer was



`1005 00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:38,780`
yes. So, I mean, I guess we were



`1006 00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:41,080`
pretty well off, but...



`1007 00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:42,800`
I mean, that's another part of, like,



`1008 00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,980`
getting back to, like, what can



`1009 00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:47,020`
you do now? Yeah. Right? I would also



`1010 00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:48,940`
say, like, some of the things we say about



`1011 00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:50,080`
Trisys is, like, one,



`1012 00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:52,900`
you know, the SOC people, whoever's in charge of your



`1013 00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:54,840`
security, you know, should



`1014 00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,880`
at least have enough communication with the plan managers to



`1015 00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,620`
understand when these things are getting configured.



`1016 00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:00,860`
Right? So then they know, like, that's when the traffic's



`1017 00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:02,820`
supposed to be there. Yeah. Right? At least that.



`1018 00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,060`
Yeah. The other thing I'd recommend



`1019 00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:06,800`
is, you know, whoever's monitoring



`1020 00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:08,840`
your network, if they are monitoring the communications



`1021 00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:10,900`
between the EWS and whatever the system



`1022 00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:13,020`
is, or whatever the controller is, is, like,



`1023 00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:14,780`
pay attention the next time things get configured.



`1024 00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:16,900`
Look at what that traffic looks like. Yeah. So, if you



`1025 00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:18,860`
see it outside the normal operating windows, you know, like,



`1026 00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:20,800`
oh, crap, like, this isn't something. Right. Just



`1027 00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:22,920`
even to get a general sense, right? So, at the very least, you can be



`1028 00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:24,880`
like, okay, this is what it is. Because right now



`1029 00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:26,520`
we just don't have the tools, right? Like, what we're



`1030 00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:28,680`
trying to do, I mean, this is the problem,



`1031 00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:30,880`
the big problem with ICS is we're trying to



`1032 00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:32,840`
catch up to what we've done in the



`1033 00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:34,660`
Microsoft Windows and Apple and stuff, right?



`1034 00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:37,020`
Right now, you know, comparably,



`1035 00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:38,660`
if we saw an executable



`1036 00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:40,780`
PE32 executable fly across the wire,



`1037 00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,720`
you know, a tool would parse it, it would run against all these signatures



`1038 00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:44,720`
and everything, tell you what it is and give you a bunch of



`1039 00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,720`
information on the status. If we had no idea



`1040 00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,660`
what Windows was and a PE executable flew by,



`1041 00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:50,860`
it would just look like binary. We'd have no idea what it is. And that's what we're doing.



`1042 00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:52,780`
We're playing catch up before we can do any of the



`1043 00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:54,760`
things that sort of the, in the IT space



`1044 00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:56,640`
that we're doing that's like advanced detections.



`1045 00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:58,420`
You know, we just need visibility.



`1046 00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:00,840`
Right, right. And I think



`1047 01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:02,580`
that's an excellent



`1048 01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:04,720`
takeaway. I mean, gain that visibility



`1049 01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,200`
within your OT



`1050 01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,720`
environment to be able



`1051 01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,540`
to do analysis on



`1052 01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:12,740`
traffic patterns and so on and so



`1053 01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:14,580`
forth. At least



`1054 01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:16,500`
in my experience, I think, looking



`1055 01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:18,520`
at traffic in an OT network where you



`1056 01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:19,220`
don't have any



`1057 01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:22,420`
users browsing the internet



`1058 01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:24,060`
and doing all kinds of crazy stuff



`1059 01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:26,620`
on the wire, it's



`1060 01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:28,480`
fairly easy to build up a baseline



`1061 01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,420`
of what does my plant



`1062 01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:31,040`
look like?



`1063 01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:34,620`
And what is normal traffic? What is



`1064 01:00:34,620 --> 01:00:36,620`
anomalies? And so on.



`1065 01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:38,020`
Yeah, yeah. On the one hand,



`1066 01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:40,460`
yeah, so background, I guess, for



`1067 01:00:40,460 --> 01:00:42,180`
the people here, but I came from IT



`1068 01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:44,100`
doing malware analysis and things like that and



`1069 01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:44,560`
moving



`1070 01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:46,260`
to Dragos and started doing this ICS stuff.



`1071 01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:47,860`
And one of the things I've noticed is that



`1072 01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:50,420`
the malware that's ICS targeted or



`1073 01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:52,440`
targeting ICS companies, it's a lot of living



`1074 01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:54,440`
off the land stuff or really simple implants and from



`1075 01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:56,540`
a malware analysis perspective,



`1076 01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:58,620`
it's not really that difficult to deal with in terms



`1077 01:00:58,620 --> 01:01:00,140`
of like, oh, what does this do and whatever.



`1078 01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,400`
The problem here that's



`1079 01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,420`
very difficult, right, in the



`1080 01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:06,360`
IT space, we have fairly homogenous



`1081 01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:08,440`
operating systems, right? There's Linux, there's Windows,



`1082 01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:10,440`
there's, well, really Linux and



`1083 01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:11,640`
Windows in the enterprise, let's be real.



`1084 01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:14,500`
As much as I like Apple



`1085 01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:16,500`
products, you know, like I see a lot of enterprise Apple



`1086 01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:18,400`
stuff, right? And, you know,



`1087 01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:20,460`
all the understandings there, the operating system understanding there,



`1088 01:01:20,540 --> 01:01:22,460`
the executable understanding is there, how they're put together,



`1089 01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:24,620`
how things are loaded, all these things are well-researched, documented



`1090 01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:25,440`
or open source.



`1091 01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:28,380`
The larger problem in ICS is we have a



`1092 01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:30,200`
fragmented operating system



`1093 01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:32,460`
landscape. And that's what's difficult.



`1094 01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:34,500`
You know, Codasys is basically an operating



`1095 01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:36,460`
system, right? Proconos is an operating system.



`1096 01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:38,280`
Whatever RSLogix is doing is



`1097 01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:40,000`
an operating system. Triconics.



`1098 01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:42,320`
And it's like, yo, why are we doing this to ourselves?



`1099 01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:44,360`
We've made the problem so much harder than it



`1100 01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:46,440`
needs to be, right? And the same thing



`1101 01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:48,180`
with, like, whatever they do.



`1102 01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:50,440`
And then we have the custom compilers that can only...



`1103 01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,560`
And all these things aren't well-researched because the ICS



`1104 01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:54,080`
community doesn't really



`1105 01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:56,020`
approach things from, like, a...



`1106 01:01:56,020 --> 01:01:58,300`
Well, they haven't, from, like, sort of, like, what would be easy



`1107 01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:00,340`
to defend against, right? Or defend...



`1108 01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:01,580`
What would be easy to defend, really?



`1109 01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,380`
Or even, like, a more, like, I mean,



`1110 01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:06,580`
honestly, like, a programming-language-centric



`1111 01:02:06,580 --> 01:02:08,380`
kind of point of view. Like, what would make things



`1112 01:02:08,380 --> 01:02:10,400`
easier, you know? It just hasn't happened.



`1113 01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:12,380`
But do you guys think that is



`1114 01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,360`
a big part



`1115 01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:16,420`
of the problem? That there's so



`1116 01:02:16,420 --> 01:02:18,400`
much... I mean,



`1117 01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:20,400`
it's so hard to do research



`1118 01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,500`
on these things. And it's cost-prohibitive.



`1119 01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:24,540`
And it's



`1120 01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:26,300`
hard to get hold of unless



`1121 01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:27,840`
you have a, you know,



`1122 01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:29,600`
a big load of money.



`1123 01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:31,320`
And



`1124 01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:34,440`
there's really not



`1125 01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:36,080`
much...



`1126 01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:37,940`
Unless you're working for someone



`1127 01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:40,480`
particular that have, you know,



`1128 01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:42,300`
a big box of money



`1129 01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:42,680`
and



`1130 01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:46,080`
they want you to do research



`1131 01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:47,340`
on a specific product.



`1132 01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:49,280`
You don't get access to that.



`1133 01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:50,240`
I mean...



`1134 01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:52,200`
Right. And we're lucky to be in a



`1135 01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:54,400`
place where, yeah, we do have the money



`1136 01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:56,360`
where, okay, we can go acquire this hardware



`1137 01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:58,280`
and have the time to analyze the network



`1138 01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:00,120`
protocol. Partnerships and...



`1139 01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:02,320`
This isn't something that, unfortunately,



`1140 01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:04,120`
the whole community can do yet because of that.



`1141 01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:05,660`
That's hurting us.



`1142 01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:08,400`
Right. And that's, I think,



`1143 01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:10,380`
why there are so few security



`1144 01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:12,560`
researchers looking at,



`1145 01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:13,300`
you know, that ICS stuff.



`1146 01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:15,640`
Yeah. Because it is



`1147 01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:18,260`
hard to get hold of.



`1148 01:03:18,820 --> 01:03:20,940`
And, yeah.



`1149 01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:22,420`
Yeah. Both the hardware and the software



`1150 01:03:22,420 --> 01:03:24,380`
are hard to get a hold of. I mean, you can buy



`1151 01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:26,240`
the hardware on eBay, sometimes cheaply,



`1152 01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:27,640`
you know, but even getting



`1153 01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:30,340`
a licensed copy of the software



`1154 01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:31,700`
is hard. Yes.



`1155 01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:34,140`
You can buy the PLCs,



`1156 01:03:34,420 --> 01:03:36,160`
but to get... Good luck



`1157 01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:37,560`
programming it. Yeah.



`1158 01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,400`
Good luck programming it. Exactly.



`1159 01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:39,960`
Yeah.



`1160 01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:42,000`
That's,



`1161 01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:44,980`
what would you say,



`1162 01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:47,420`
where do you think the ICS



`1163 01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:48,880`
community



`1164 01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:51,680`
in terms of security research will be



`1165 01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:53,720`
in, let's say, 10 years? Will we have



`1166 01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:55,520`
caught up to where



`1167 01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:57,640`
IT is today, or are we still



`1168 01:03:57,640 --> 01:03:59,580`
lagging behind? We'll



`1169 01:03:59,580 --> 01:04:01,660`
probably still be lagging behind where IT



`1170 01:04:01,660 --> 01:04:03,700`
is now. And I think, of course,



`1171 01:04:03,820 --> 01:04:06,020`
you know, IT methodologies



`1172 01:04:06,020 --> 01:04:07,520`
will be continuing to plod



`1173 01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,520`
forward in that time, too. I mean, it's kind of



`1174 01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:11,480`
always been the case with ICS



`1175 01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:12,340`
security, I think.



`1176 01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:14,540`
We're always quite a ways behind.



`1177 01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:16,240`
You know, we used to refer to this



`1178 01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:18,240`
industrial control system security



`1179 01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:20,260`
loss decade in the early



`1180 01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:22,540`
2000s. It was like, oh, why don't even



`1181 01:04:22,540 --> 01:04:24,580`
PLCs have basic security



`1182 01:04:24,580 --> 01:04:26,140`
features like authentication? Well,



`1183 01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:28,060`
for the most part, they still don't.



`1184 01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:30,580`
You know, and that's, we're now 10 or 15



`1185 01:04:30,580 --> 01:04:32,620`
years after the loss decade, and we still



`1186 01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:33,780`
haven't quite caught up.



`1187 01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:36,560`
What happened to code signatures and things like



`1188 01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:37,520`
that? Yeah.



`1189 01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:40,580`
Yeah, I mean, it kind of depends



`1190 01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:41,860`
on what you mean by catch up.



`1191 01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:44,220`
Right? Like, what are we catching up



`1192 01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:46,100`
to? Like, what's the sort of



`1193 01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:48,280`
goalposts that you say



`1194 01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:49,480`
are going to keep moving?



`1195 01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:52,400`
Like, so, for example,



`1196 01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,220`
like, when I think about it, if



`1197 01:04:54,220 --> 01:04:55,980`
the Triconics operating system is like Windows



`1198 01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:57,900`
95, and we happen to get,



`1199 01:04:58,080 --> 01:04:59,980`
we don't have it yet, maybe we'll get it eventually,



`1200 01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:01,300`
I don't know. I say yet, we don't know.



`1201 01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:04,020`
That was firmware version 10, and then we get firmware



`1202 01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:05,920`
version 11. Sure. And we look at that.



`1203 01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:07,880`
Is that operating system a little bit more up to date?



`1204 01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:10,120`
Is that operating system more like Windows 98 or XP?



`1205 01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:12,020`
I mean, we don't know. Like, what are the,



`1206 01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:14,220`
know what the ICS vendors are learning



`1207 01:05:14,220 --> 01:05:16,420`
from the modern operating system world,



`1208 01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:18,260`
or if they are even trying to learn



`1209 01:05:18,260 --> 01:05:20,260`
from the modern operating system world. So, for me,



`1210 01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:22,380`
it's hard to, it's like when you calculate



`1211 01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:24,240`
slope, you need two points to figure out, like,



`1212 01:05:24,260 --> 01:05:26,340`
what the, you know, the direction is. I don't have



`1213 01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:28,420`
two points of reference for operating systems yet



`1214 01:05:28,420 --> 01:05:29,820`
in the ICS field



`1215 01:05:29,820 --> 01:05:32,480`
to be able to say, like, oh yeah, we're progressing



`1216 01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:34,480`
in any sort of way. Read's been around longer



`1217 01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:36,320`
than me in terms of, like, the authentication and all these



`1218 01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:38,120`
things, but that's what I'm looking at. I'm like,



`1219 01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:40,100`
how secure are these operating systems?



`1220 01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:42,040`
And I don't have the data points for that yet.



`1221 01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:44,520`
So, pretty dismal.



`1222 01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:46,580`
Yeah, yeah. It's depressing



`1223 01:05:46,580 --> 01:05:47,460`
at times, I think.



`1224 01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:50,400`
Maybe because it's like I'm still a little green.



`1225 01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:51,760`
Yeah, yeah. You'll get there.



`1226 01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:54,560`
I'm not really that depressed by it. It's just a,



`1227 01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:56,740`
you know, it's a reality you have to accept,



`1228 01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:58,260`
I guess. And another thing, I mean,



`1229 01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:00,140`
that I will touch upon



`1230 01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:01,280`
tomorrow, but



`1231 01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:04,420`
about disclosure. I mean,



`1232 01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:06,120`
how should you work with that?



`1233 01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:08,200`
Because, like I say,



`1234 01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:09,360`
even if there's



`1235 01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:11,360`
a new product or



`1236 01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:12,540`
a new software,



`1237 01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:14,360`
firmware or something



`1238 01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:16,360`
that is fixing the problem,



`1239 01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:18,020`
it's going to be



`1240 01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:20,540`
ages before that is implemented



`1241 01:06:20,540 --> 01:06:22,340`
in all the customer systems.



`1242 01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:24,620`
This goes back to what we were talking about



`1243 01:06:24,620 --> 01:06:26,480`
before. It's not...



`1244 01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,360`
Patching is one small part of a defensive



`1245 01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:30,380`
strategy. Visibility



`1246 01:06:30,380 --> 01:06:31,860`
and detection is more important.



`1247 01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:34,280`
So, if you know the thing is wrong,



`1248 01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:36,540`
figure out how you detect the wrong thing. And then it doesn't



`1249 01:06:36,540 --> 01:06:38,620`
matter if you weren't patched. I mean, it matters a little



`1250 01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:40,180`
bit, but it doesn't matter because you'll be able to see.



`1251 01:06:40,180 --> 01:06:42,420`
So, everything is known. And to some



`1252 01:06:42,420 --> 01:06:43,820`
extent, I feel like that is more important.



`1253 01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:46,480`
Right? And that's sort of the way



`1254 01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:48,640`
I look at it. Because if you're going to have this long time to patch



`1255 01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:50,520`
and you're not necessarily going to be able to update



`1256 01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:52,180`
it, because we've dealt with sensors where they're like, no,



`1257 01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:54,420`
the customer can't update that. One of our guys has to fly



`1258 01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:56,300`
out there and update it. It's like, well,



`1259 01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:58,380`
if that's the process, then you just need



`1260 01:06:58,380 --> 01:07:00,340`
visibility. I don't want to say that's



`1261 01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:02,380`
a solution, but it's as close as



`1262 01:07:02,380 --> 01:07:04,500`
we're going to get to a solution, at least for the time



`1263 01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:06,420`
being, until something significant changes.



`1264 01:07:07,220 --> 01:07:08,500`
Yeah. But yeah,



`1265 01:07:08,580 --> 01:07:10,420`
on the disclosure window thing, I mean,



`1266 01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:12,340`
I've been all over on disclosure, you know, back



`1267 01:07:12,340 --> 01:07:14,360`
in the day, I used to drop O-Days on vendors all



`1268 01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:16,340`
the time. Now we do a lot more



`1269 01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:18,020`
private reporting where we say,



`1270 01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:20,360`
we're never going to publicly report



`1271 01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:22,160`
on vulnerabilities. We'll report it to the vendor.



`1272 01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:24,580`
We'll get in touch with as many customers as we can



`1273 01:07:24,580 --> 01:07:26,640`
and let them know, like, hey, there was this problem.



`1274 01:07:26,780 --> 01:07:27,540`
It's been fixed.



`1275 01:07:28,180 --> 01:07:29,520`
And try to do it quietly



`1276 01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:32,500`
and see how that works out. But I won't



`1277 01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:34,520`
fault anyone if they decide that they're



`1278 01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:36,740`
going to take a vulnerability and release



`1279 01:07:36,740 --> 01:07:38,100`
a working exploit, even.



`1280 01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:40,560`
I totally get it, because



`1281 01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:42,320`
having worked with a lot of



`1282 01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:44,200`
vendors, it's such a slow



`1283 01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:46,240`
process. It requires a lot



`1284 01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:47,520`
of input from the researcher.



`1285 01:07:48,020 --> 01:07:50,160`
It can be really difficult, and I don't think



`1286 01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,200`
vendors always appreciate how much time goes



`1287 01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:54,340`
into, you know, the security



`1288 01:07:54,340 --> 01:07:56,220`
research. They kind of



`1289 01:07:56,220 --> 01:07:58,300`
treat it as a free resource, and they may



`1290 01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:00,260`
sit and take two, three years



`1291 01:08:00,260 --> 01:08:02,100`
to actually fix the vulnerability.



`1292 01:08:02,860 --> 01:08:04,160`
And in that time, you have to



`1293 01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:06,160`
constantly be poking them and saying, like, you



`1294 01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:08,160`
really need to put out an advisory about this



`1295 01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:10,300`
and let your customers know that they need



`1296 01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:12,220`
to update or at least, you know, put



`1297 01:08:12,220 --> 01:08:14,160`
in some firewall rules and what to block



`1298 01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:16,040`
and what to look for for anomaly detection.



`1299 01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:20,200`
Do you think there will ever be



`1300 01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:22,480`
like bug bounty programs for ICS?



`1301 01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:23,980`
Probably eventually.



`1302 01:08:24,220 --> 01:08:26,040`
Yeah, I hope so. I think that



`1303 01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:28,240`
right now, just because of the,



`1304 01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:30,140`
you know, most of these systems lack



`1305 01:08:30,140 --> 01:08:32,220`
really basic security features like authentication,



`1306 01:08:32,660 --> 01:08:34,360`
I don't view the bug bounty program



`1307 01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,240`
as being particularly worthwhile, just because



`1308 01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:38,060`
it's like, oh, well, you found a buffer



`1309 01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:40,220`
overflow vulnerability in some runtime,



`1310 01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:42,180`
but the runtime didn't have any security



`1311 01:08:42,180 --> 01:08:44,000`
anyway, so a



`1312 01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,260`
real attacker probably isn't going to use the



`1313 01:08:46,260 --> 01:08:48,300`
bug, they're just going to use whatever features



`1314 01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:50,140`
are present in the service to



`1315 01:08:50,140 --> 01:08:52,160`
compromise the system



`1316 01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:54,160`
and go that route. I've always



`1317 01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:56,440`
found the vulnerability problem in both sectors,



`1318 01:08:56,580 --> 01:08:58,380`
ICS and IT, to be a little...



`1319 01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:00,320`
It's a symptom of a



`1320 01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:02,080`
larger problem, which is just better development



`1321 01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:04,600`
practices, and that's what needs to happen in ICS.



`1322 01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:06,140`
Right? Because then you



`1323 01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:07,860`
get the basic stuff out of the way,



`1324 01:09:07,860 --> 01:09:09,940`
and then the software is to a point



`1325 01:09:09,940 --> 01:09:12,100`
where you can have a bug bounty program and it actually makes sense.



`1326 01:09:12,180 --> 01:09:13,980`
Otherwise, the companies are going to go broke.



`1327 01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:14,380`
Yeah.



`1328 01:09:15,380 --> 01:09:18,080`
I think that's a very



`1329 01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:19,840`
valid point, and I think



`1330 01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:22,280`
that's where I believe



`1331 01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:23,720`
the ICS



`1332 01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:27,500`
side of the house could



`1333 01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:29,240`
catch up faster.



`1334 01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:32,100`
They don't have to go through and learn



`1335 01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:34,280`
by doing all the mistakes,



`1336 01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:35,960`
because there are



`1337 01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:38,040`
sound practices for co-development,



`1338 01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:39,920`
and there are



`1339 01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:41,660`
processes that you can implement



`1340 01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:43,900`
to make sure that you don't have



`1341 01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:45,860`
issues. I mean, do a threat



`1342 01:09:45,860 --> 01:09:47,420`
modeling and things like that.



`1343 01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:49,920`
Right, and come up with your list of



`1344 01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:51,860`
okay, here are my



`1345 01:09:51,860 --> 01:09:53,700`
inputs to the system,



`1346 01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:55,940`
and develop a threat



`1347 01:09:55,940 --> 01:09:57,000`
model against those inputs.



`1348 01:09:58,060 --> 01:09:59,880`
So I think that is



`1349 01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:01,820`
true. I mean, there is a huge benefit to



`1350 01:10:01,820 --> 01:10:03,900`
Microsoft and other companies already



`1351 01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:05,880`
having gone through that process,



`1352 01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:07,840`
and now you can just take their process and



`1353 01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:09,980`
hopefully work your pipeline around it.



`1354 01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,520`
Microsoft SDL book,



`1355 01:10:11,660 --> 01:10:13,780`
that should be a required reading for all



`1356 01:10:13,780 --> 01:10:14,340`
developers.



`1357 01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,900`
Oh, for sure. And some vendors



`1358 01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:19,540`
are starting to take that seriously.



`1359 01:10:19,780 --> 01:10:21,740`
I mean, they actually, when they develop products now,



`1360 01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:23,440`
they actually do



`1361 01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:25,420`
a software development life cycle.



`1362 01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,940`
They say, okay, this is



`1363 01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:29,840`
starting



`1364 01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:31,420`
with a threat model on the new product,



`1365 01:10:31,580 --> 01:10:33,980`
and going through that process, and actually



`1366 01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:35,880`
testing the artifacts that come out of that,



`1367 01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:37,580`
and all that. Yeah, and then all the other



`1368 01:10:37,580 --> 01:10:39,380`
nice useful tools, right? Like actual



`1369 01:10:39,380 --> 01:10:41,640`
runtime testing, and not runtime testing,



`1370 01:10:41,660 --> 01:10:43,660`
I'm sorry, like your



`1371 01:10:43,660 --> 01:10:45,400`
what is it called?



`1372 01:10:47,540 --> 01:10:48,080`
You know,



`1373 01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:49,840`
well, just doing the basic testing



`1374 01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:51,860`
stuff, like your unit tests, and then



`1375 01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:53,800`
your static code analyzers, and



`1376 01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:55,940`
all fuzzing, like these things



`1377 01:10:55,940 --> 01:10:58,080`
that need to sort of be built into your larger dev process



`1378 01:10:58,080 --> 01:10:59,760`
need to just be there. And I don't know how much of that



`1379 01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:01,920`
they're actually doing. I think some



`1380 01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,900`
vendors are better than others, but even the ones



`1381 01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:05,780`
that claim they're doing



`1382 01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:08,180`
a secure development process



`1383 01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:10,000`
end up releasing new products that clearly



`1384 01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,640`
had not been tested, or at least not.



`1385 01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:13,480`
Yeah, not to any sufficient degree.



`1386 01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:15,040`
You know what I think?



`1387 01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:17,180`
Bugs are going to be there. Oh, yeah, for sure.



`1388 01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:19,680`
We want certain bugs not



`1389 01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:21,600`
to be there. Yeah. Right, there are certain classes



`1390 01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,280`
of bugs I think we can eliminate, like



`1391 01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:25,720`
we were talking about in our talk, or maybe during the Q&A



`1392 01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:26,600`
for a second, like



`1393 01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:29,680`
you know, the JVM has



`1394 01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:31,700`
like a by-code verifier, and it guarantees



`1395 01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:33,320`
that certain problems won't occur.



`1396 01:11:33,860 --> 01:11:35,680`
And we need things like that, right?



`1397 01:11:35,780 --> 01:11:37,600`
Like, you know, right now



`1398 01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:39,600`
as it stands, a lot of these controllers that we



`1399 01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,600`
can get arbitrary code execution out of, we could just



`1400 01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:43,760`
brick. Right? We could just crash



`1401 01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:45,300`
the thing and be done with it. Yeah.



`1402 01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:47,960`
Which isn't an ideal situation. That shouldn't be a possibility.



`1403 01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:49,700`
Right? Like, so



`1404 01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:51,660`
if, for example, like a controller, I'm not saying a controller



`1405 01:11:51,660 --> 01:11:53,580`
needs to run the JVM, because that would be a little insane,



`1406 01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:55,740`
but something like it, that could



`1407 01:11:55,740 --> 01:11:57,760`
actually, before it ran its code, it just



`1408 01:11:57,760 --> 01:11:59,700`
did a little check and said, okay, it meets these



`1409 01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:01,700`
properties. That would be miles ahead of



`1410 01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:03,600`
what we have now. Yeah. Because it would mean certain things we



`1411 01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:05,480`
wouldn't necessarily have to worry about. Not to say that



`1412 01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:07,600`
that verifier would have vulnerabilities and there couldn't be



`1413 01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:09,760`
some problems, but we've kind of narrowed things



`1414 01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:11,600`
down now. It's like a little bit easier, right? We can



`1415 01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:13,160`
focus on this one little verification thing.



`1416 01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:15,560`
And we don't even have that, and



`1417 01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:17,720`
they could very easily do that. So, like, the one thing that



`1418 01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:19,620`
I really wish vendors would do is when



`1419 01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:21,620`
they're looking at re-releasing their next operating system,



`1420 01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:23,760`
they're like, okay, what would it cost, right,



`1421 01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:25,760`
to, like, port this



`1422 01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:27,560`
OS or whatever it is to, like,



`1423 01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:29,560`
a type-safe language. Just that.



`1424 01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,640`
Just a type-safe language, you know,



`1425 01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:32,960`
would work. You know, like,



`1426 01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:35,320`
even if it's, like, Rust or something. Right.



`1427 01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:37,520`
That wouldn't be the best, but it would still work.



`1428 01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:39,520`
You know, because at least it would be type-safe and there's a whole class of



`1429 01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:40,380`
errors you don't have to deal with.



`1430 01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:42,300`
Yeah. Golang.



`1431 01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:44,380`
Yeah. Maybe not Golang, but...



`1432 01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:47,840`
I mean, well, you'd have to write...



`1433 01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:49,660`
The thing is, you'd have to be able to...



`1434 01:12:49,660 --> 01:12:52,360`
Golang still... The problem with Rust and Golang is you still have to compile it.



`1435 01:12:52,460 --> 01:12:54,500`
Yeah. Right, so it'll compile down to the assembly language.



`1436 01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:56,380`
So you'd still be sending raw bytecodes to the



`1437 01:12:57,020 --> 01:12:58,420`
system. And that



`1438 01:12:58,420 --> 01:12:59,600`
could be exploited then. Yeah.



`1439 01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:02,200`
The system needs a way to sort of, like,



`1440 01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:04,520`
I don't want to say type-check, but sort of, like, type-check



`1441 01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:06,440`
the assembly it's getting. So, like,



`1442 01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:08,300`
the JVM and the .NET runtime



`1443 01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:10,360`
makes sense because the bytecodes that



`1444 01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:12,320`
it admits are... It's basically like



`1445 01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:14,500`
a typed assembly language, right? The type information



`1446 01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:16,560`
is still present. So the controller



`1447 01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:18,540`
or whatever is loading, in this case the JVM



`1448 01:13:18,540 --> 01:13:20,320`
or whatever that is loading the code, has



`1449 01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:22,420`
enough information to say, oh, well, you know,



`1450 01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:24,360`
this operation is illegal because these two



`1451 01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:26,440`
types don't match. Yeah. Right, and you can start checking



`1452 01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:28,540`
for, like, out-of-bounds memory access and these kinds of things



`1453 01:13:28,540 --> 01:13:30,140`
because there's extra metadata



`1454 01:13:30,140 --> 01:13:32,460`
inside of the assembly language that allows it to do



`1455 01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:34,300`
that, right? So any of these sort of, like,



`1456 01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:36,300`
higher-level languages would allow it, but the



`1457 01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:38,480`
compiled ones, you'd have to develop a mechanism for doing



`1458 01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:40,320`
those kinds of checks or, like, pass extra



`1459 01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:42,420`
metadata. You know,



`1460 01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:44,440`
I mean, that's the kind of thing I think needs



`1461 01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:46,400`
to happen is because these programs are simple.



`1462 01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:49,120`
Yeah. They are. You don't need to be



`1463 01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:50,720`
running straight PowerPC to, like,



`1464 01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,620`
you know, check a



`1465 01:13:52,620 --> 01:13:54,620`
pressure sensor. Yeah. Why does



`1466 01:13:54,620 --> 01:13:56,520`
it matter if it's... Yeah, it always surprises



`1467 01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:58,520`
me that, you know, 6.1.1.3.1,



`1468 01:13:58,620 --> 01:14:00,540`
the standards for programming logic



`1469 01:14:00,540 --> 01:14:02,500`
and controllers, is a Turing complete programming



`1470 01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:04,620`
language. And it always just surprises me



`1471 01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:06,620`
a little bit to think about that. I'm like, do we really



`1472 01:14:06,620 --> 01:14:08,500`
need that? You know, if we're just



`1473 01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:10,360`
going to be comparing sensor inputs and



`1474 01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:12,560`
controlling some outputs, yeah, you want



`1475 01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:14,540`
some, maybe some more complex control logic



`1476 01:14:14,540 --> 01:14:16,440`
in some cases, but do we really



`1477 01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:18,460`
need a Turing complete programming language? And some



`1478 01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:20,500`
of these, like, some of these run



`1479 01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:22,440`
times actually have more advanced features.



`1480 01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:24,420`
You know, it's like, oh, you can actually program



`1481 01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:26,440`
an arbitrary TCP client and



`1482 01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:28,580`
server in the PLC for,



`1483 01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:30,600`
like, grabbing data off of some remote system.



`1484 01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:32,480`
I'm like, do we really need that? I



`1485 01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:34,560`
know it's there for a reason. I know it's there because



`1486 01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:36,520`
some customer wanted it. They said, oh, we've



`1487 01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:38,580`
got this weird system with some weird



`1488 01:14:38,580 --> 01:14:40,340`
protocol, and we want the PLC,



`1489 01:14:40,380 --> 01:14:42,500`
to be able to pull that weird system, get



`1490 01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:44,560`
some data out of it, parse that response,



`1491 01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:46,560`
and then do some control logic based on it.



`1492 01:14:47,180 --> 01:14:48,380`
But you have to be like, why?



`1493 01:14:48,740 --> 01:14:50,220`
I wish we



`1494 01:14:50,220 --> 01:14:52,160`
hadn't agreed to do this.



`1495 01:14:52,340 --> 01:14:53,600`
What is that that reminds me of, like,



`1496 01:14:54,020 --> 01:14:56,440`
one of the number one rules of security? I feel like you learn



`1497 01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:58,140`
it when you're in college, and you think security



`1498 01:14:58,140 --> 01:15:00,380`
is whatever. It's like, that's sort of like the principle



`1499 01:15:00,380 --> 01:15:02,400`
of least privilege. Things only need



`1500 01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:03,780`
as much access as they're required.



`1501 01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:05,660`
And, like, ICS just completely



`1502 01:15:05,660 --> 01:15:07,660`
failed at that off the bat.



`1503 01:15:07,660 --> 01:15:08,220`
Right, yeah.



`1504 01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:10,120`
It can do everything.



`1505 01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:15,040`
Awesome. I think that's a good note



`1506 01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:16,920`
to end this interview. And, Jimmy,



`1507 01:15:17,340 --> 01:15:19,280`
Reid, thank you very much for taking



`1508 01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:21,000`
time to talk to us. It was



`1509 01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,340`
really nice listening



`1510 01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:25,240`
to your talk, and it was even nicer



`1511 01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:26,740`
talking to you now. Thank you.



`1512 01:15:26,940 --> 01:15:27,680`
Thank you.



`1513 01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:30,700`
And that is over and out from



`1514 01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:33,020`
Säkerhetspodcasten, och jag som pratar här heter



`1515 01:15:33,020 --> 01:15:34,820`
Rickard Borgfors. Ha det gott. Hej.
